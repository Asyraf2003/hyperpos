# HyperPOS Database Migration Contract

Status: Active migration contract reference  
Scope: MySQL schema hardening toward PostgreSQL-aligned structure  
Runtime DB now: MySQL  
Future target: PostgreSQL-ready schema discipline, not immediate PostgreSQL cutover

## Goal

The goal of this migration folder is to keep the current MySQL schema structured so that a future PostgreSQL transition is significantly easier.

This does not mean PostgreSQL is active now.

This means new and revised migrations must avoid MySQL-only domain assumptions and must keep finance, stock, audit, projection, and reporting tables portable, explicit, and traceable.

## Before

The migration history currently contains a mixed MySQL-era structure:

- domain tables mostly use string primary keys
- employee/payroll/debt tables use UUID primary keys
- framework/system tables may still use numeric IDs
- money is mostly stored as integer or big integer rupiah
- some fields still rely on MySQL unsigned semantics
- some migrations use MySQL-oriented helpers such as after/change
- JSON storage is mixed between native json columns and text payload columns
- source tables and projection tables exist, but projection materialization policy is not fully uniform
- some legacy seeders still direct-write source/projection/audit tables

## After Target

The target structure is:

- domain identity is explicit and stable
- domain IDs use string or UUID based on table contract
- framework/system numeric IDs stay internal only
- money is stored as integer rupiah, never float or decimal
- status columns use string values, never MySQL enum
- business dates, action timestamps, created_at, and updated_at are not mixed
- JSON is allowed only for snapshot, metadata, draft, or compatibility payload
- JSON must not be the only source of truth for money, status, source ID, actor ID, business date, inventory quantity, payment/refund amount, or report-critical facts
- financial history must not cascade-delete casually
- projection/read-model tables are not canonical financial truth
- indexes must follow real read paths, not guesswork
- PostgreSQL-incompatible assumptions must be documented before new schema work

## ID Policy

Allowed:

- string primary keys for domain tables
- UUID primary keys for domains already modeled as UUID
- numeric IDs for Laravel/framework/system-owned tables only

Forbidden:

- exposing auto-increment IDs as domain/public identity
- adding new mixed identity styles without table-level reason
- relying on numeric framework IDs for finance domain references unless explicitly internal

## Money Policy

Allowed:

- integer
- bigInteger
- explicit signed integer when negative value is valid domain behavior

Forbidden:

- float
- decimal as official rupiah truth
- formatted strings such as 15.000
- relying only on MySQL unsigned as a financial invariant

All rupiah values must reconcile exactly. A one-rupiah mismatch is a defect.

## Date and Time Policy

Do not mix date meanings.

Business/report dates:

- transaction_date
- paid_at
- refunded_at
- tanggal_pengiriman
- tanggal_terima
- tanggal_mutasi
- effective_date where needed

Action/audit timestamps:

- occurred_at
- closed_at
- reopened_at
- uploaded_at
- performed_at where needed

System timestamps:

- created_at
- updated_at

Rules:

- created_at is not transaction_date
- transaction_date is not audit occurred_at
- paid_at/refunded_at are financial event dates
- projection timestamps should use projected_at or rebuilt_at when semantics are selected

## Source Table vs Projection Table

Source-of-truth tables must be seeded and migrated before projections.

Source examples:

- notes
- work_items
- customer_payments
- customer_refunds
- payment_allocations
- payment_component_allocations
- refund_component_allocations
- supplier_invoices
- supplier_invoice_lines
- supplier_receipts
- supplier_payments
- inventory_movements
- audit_events
- note_mutation_events
- version tables

Projection/read-model examples:

- product_inventory
- product_inventory_costing
- note_history_projection
- supplier_invoice_list_projection
- supplier_list_projection

Projection tables must be rebuildable from source or explicitly documented as current-state tables.

## PostgreSQL Readiness Watchlist

Every migration review must check:

- unsignedInteger
- unsignedBigInteger
- after()
- change()
- mediumText
- longText used as JSON payload
- dateTime vs timestamp semantics
- MySQL enum
- cascadeOnDelete on financial history
- raw JSON financial truth
- money stored outside integer/bigInteger
- source/projection ambiguity

## Change Rule

Do not mass-edit old migrations without a clear baseline decision.

Preferred order:

1. document current migration contract
2. audit migration risk by group
3. patch one table group at a time
4. add new compatibility migrations when preserving deployed history matters
5. edit old migrations only when the branch is intentionally treated as rebuildable schema history
6. update seeders only after DB contract is clear

## Current Next Target

First technical target after this README:

- classify unsigned fields into:
  - harmless counter
  - non-negative financial/counter invariant needing validation
  - PostgreSQL check constraint candidate
  - migration rewrite candidate

Do not start seeder rewrite before this classification is done.

## Current Migration Compatibility Scan - unsigned/layout/text

Status: Active classification target  
Source command:

    rg -n -- "unsignedInteger|unsignedBigInteger|->after\\(|->change\\(|mediumText|longText|enum" database/migrations

## Scan Result Classification

### 1. Framework-owned tables

These are Laravel/framework tables. They are not domain financial truth and should not be patched in the first domain migration hardening slice.

- `0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php`
  - `longText('payload')`
- `0001_01_01_000001_create_cache_table.php`
  - `mediumText('value')`
- `0001_01_01_000002_create_jobs_table.php`
  - `longText('payload')`
  - `longText('failed_job_ids')`
  - `mediumText('options')`
  - `longText('exception')`
  - unsigned framework queue timestamps/counters

Decision:

- Keep for now.
- Do not mix framework table cleanup with domain PostgreSQL-readiness work.

### 2. MySQL layout helpers

These are mostly column-order helpers. They are PostgreSQL-hostile as migration syntax style, but not domain truth by themselves.

Detected patterns:

- `->after(...)`
- `->change()`

Affected examples:

- product/supplier soft-delete foundation
- product search normalization
- supplier invoice revision line additions
- supplier receipt line snapshots
- employee master v2 alteration
- payment method/cash detail addition
- current revision pointer on notes
- operational timestamp additions

Decision:

- Do not mass-remove blindly.
- Prefer removing or rewriting only when touching the same migration group.
- `->change()` is higher risk than `->after()` because it can require DBAL/platform-specific behavior.

### 3. Domain unsigned counters/revision numbers

These represent non-negative counters or revision numbers.

Affected fields include:

- `supplier_invoices.last_revision_no`
- `inventory_cost_adjustments.source_revision_no`
- `supplier_invoice_lines.revision_no`
- `employee_versions.revision_no`
- `supplier_invoice_versions.revision_no`
- `product_versions.revision_no`
- `supplier_versions.revision_no`
- `notes.latest_revision_number`
- `note_revisions.revision_number`
- `note_revisions.line_count`
- `note_revision_lines.line_no`
- projection counters such as line/payment/receipt/proof counts

Decision:

- PostgreSQL has no native unsigned type.
- Future target should use signed integer/bigInteger plus explicit non-negative invariant.
- Do not weaken current MySQL DB protection until replacement invariant is planned.
- First patch candidate should classify each field as:
  - counter
  - revision number
  - file size
  - money
  - projection count

### 4. Domain unsigned money

These are more sensitive than counters.

Affected fields include:

- `note_revisions.grand_total_rupiah`
- `note_revision_lines.service_price_rupiah`
- `note_revision_lines.subtotal_rupiah`

Decision:

- Money must stay integer rupiah.
- Do not rely on unsigned as the only non-negative invariant.
- Patch requires test proof that negative values are rejected in domain/application or DB constraint.
- Do not patch together with counters unless proof scope stays small.

### 5. Domain JSON/text payload

Detected domain payload text:

- `transaction_workspace_drafts.payload_json` as `longText`
- `note_mutation_snapshots.payload_json` as `longText`

Detected native JSON:

- version snapshots
- audit metadata
- audit snapshots
- note revision line payload

Decision:

- Keep text only when payload is opaque and not queried.
- Prefer native JSON/JSONB direction when future PostgreSQL query/validation matters.
- Do not convert without read/write compatibility tests.

## First Safe Migration Refactor Order

1. Counters/revision numbers classification.
2. Domain unsigned money invariant proof.
3. JSON/text payload classification.
4. MySQL layout helper cleanup by touched group.
5. Projection timestamp/materialization policy.
6. Seeder adjustment only after migration contract is locked.

## Current Goal Statement

The goal is not to move to PostgreSQL now.

The goal is to make the current MySQL schema mature, explicit, and PostgreSQL-aligned so a future PostgreSQL transition is significantly easier and less risky.

## Live MySQL Transition Note

Status: Live-system safety note

This project currently has a live MySQL database.

Editing historical migration files does not change an already-migrated live MySQL database.

These migration edits define the intended clean/fresh schema direction and make future PostgreSQL transition easier, but they are not a live schema migration by themselves.

## Live Database Rule

For the live MySQL database:

- do not run `migrate:fresh`
- do not assume edited old migration files alter existing live columns
- do not drop/recreate finance-sensitive tables casually
- use explicit forward migration, dump/restore transform, or PostgreSQL import mapping for live transition
- every live transition step must have backup, rollback, row-count proof, money reconciliation proof, and projection rebuild proof

## Current Fresh-Schema Proof

Current local proof after unsigned cleanup:

- fresh testing migration completed successfully
- database feature tests passed
- result: 26 tests / 241 assertions

This proves the fresh MySQL schema can be rebuilt after the current migration hardening slice.

This does not prove PostgreSQL production cutover.

## Meaning Of Current Migration Edits

Current edits move the target fresh schema away from MySQL-only unsigned domain assumptions.

Changed categories:

- revision numbers
- line counters
- projection counters
- domain money fields in note revision tables

Remaining intentionally unpatched:

- Laravel framework job-table unsigned fields
- supplier payment proof `file_size_bytes`
- PostgreSQL runtime migration
- live MySQL data transformation
- PostgreSQL import/parity proof

## PostgreSQL Transition Requirement

Before live PostgreSQL transition can be claimed safe, the project still needs:

1. MySQL live backup proof.
2. MySQL schema snapshot.
3. PostgreSQL fresh migration proof.
4. Data export/import mapping.
5. Row-count parity by table group.
6. Integer rupiah reconciliation by finance domain.
7. Payment/refund/allocation reconciliation.
8. Inventory movement and projection reconciliation.
9. Audit/version/projection rebuild proof.
10. Application test suite against PostgreSQL.
11. Cutover and rollback runbook.

## Current Claim Allowed

Allowed claim:

The MySQL migration structure is being hardened toward a PostgreSQL-aligned target schema, and the current unsigned cleanup slice is fresh-schema verified on MySQL testing.

Forbidden claim:

The live system is already PostgreSQL-ready for production cutover.
