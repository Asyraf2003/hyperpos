# Finance Residual Error Log Definition of Done
## Status
Extracted draft.
This file was extracted from an existing blueprint to separate execution workflow and DoD from planning blueprint content.
This file is not an implementation patch and does not mark any error log as fixed.

## Source
- `docs/blueprint/v2/note-finance/2026-05-06-error-log-finance-residual-implementation-blueprint.md`

## Extracted Sections
## DoD For Planning

Planning is complete only when:

- finance residual blueprint exists
- covered error logs are mapped
- locked ADR-0018 and carry-forward decisions are listed
- open decision gates are explicit
- preferred implementation slices are defined
- slice order is defined
- source inventory requirements are defined
- discovery commands are defined
- characterization test rules are defined
- CLI workflow is defined
- implementation DoD is defined
- stop conditions are defined
- ADR-0019 access scope is not redefined
- ADR-0022 concurrency scope is not redefined
- no app source patch is made during planning

## DoD For Implementation

Implementation is complete only when all relevant conditions for the selected slice are proven.

### Source Boundary

- finance logic lives in application/domain/service boundary, not UI-only
- payment/refund/history rows are not destroyed
- current and historical rows are separated by policy/projection
- current payment selection excludes canceled/legacy rows
- current refund selection excludes canceled/legacy/unpaid rows
- carry-forward settlement does not double-subtract refund
- existing money is not silently lost during revision
- overpaid/surplus is not treated as unpaid
- price basis is server-authoritative
- client price basis cannot bypass minimum price
- refund endpoint cannot act as generic row delete
- paid status/outstanding/operational status agree
- report/current projection does not double-count legacy rows when affected

### Tests

- red characterization test exists before patch
- targeted test fails before patch for expected reason
- targeted test passes after patch
- relevant payment/refund/revision/reporting tests pass
- no unrelated tests are weakened
- no test is changed merely to hide a failure
- exact money examples are covered where relevant
- surplus behavior is covered as detection if storage decision remains open
- verification gap is documented when full final model needs owner decision

### Documentation

- docs/error_log finding is updated only after proof
- proof quality is stated explicitly
- ADR is not rewritten casually during implementation
- any new domain decision gets ADR/addendum
- any deviation from this blueprint is recorded with reason
- residual gaps remain visible

### Git

- git status is checked before and after
- diff contains only files in approved slice
- commit message references narrow fix
- owner reviews proof before commit
- no untracked unexpected file is left unreviewed

## Finance Blast-Radius Suite

After finance residual slices are complete, run the narrowest available suite covering:

- payment allocation
- refund allocation
- note revision
- workspace edit
- paid status
- outstanding resolver
- operational status
- current projection
- reporting if touched
- cashier/admin affected flows
- inventory if touched

Suggested final proof should include:

- targeted tests per error_log
- relevant payment suite
- relevant note suite
- relevant refund suite
- relevant reporting suite if touched
- make/audit command if project rules require it
- final git diff stat
- final docs/error_log updates
- owner acceptance

## Error Log Update Rule

Do not update `docs/error_log/*.md` before implementation proof.

When updating a finance error log, include:

- status
- exact patch scope
- tests added
- targeted command output
- blast-radius command output
- residual gaps
- owner decision reference if applicable
- commit hash after commit, if committed
- owner acceptance note if applicable

Allowed statuses:

- Reported
- Accepted risk
- Planned
- Patched with verification gap
- Fixed with proof
- Deferred with owner acceptance

Forbidden behavior:

- marking fixed because a patch exists
- hiding missing finance proof
- claiming domain decision not recorded
- changing settlement semantics without ADR/update
- deleting known gap without evidence

## Stop Conditions

Stop immediately if:

- patch changes refund engine without fresh proof and owner approval
- patch blocks cashier edit/refund globally as final solution
- patch rewrites/deletes payment/refund/history
- patch mixes current and historical rows without boundary
- patch encodes generic reader semantics before consumer behavior is proven
- patch silently drops existing note money
- patch treats carry-forward surplus as unpaid
- patch silently adjusts money without owner decision
- patch trusts client-controlled price basis
- patch lets open/unpaid row use money refund path
- patch lets forged row id refund/cancel/finalize a note
- patch changes ADR-0019 access policy without opening that scope
- patch changes ADR-0022 concurrency policy without opening that scope
- full surplus storage is needed but owner decision is still missing
- current projection schema change is needed but schema decision is not documented
- failing test reason is not understood
- broad refactor is needed before exact affected files are proven
- error_log update is attempted before proof
