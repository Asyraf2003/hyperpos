# Security ADR-0020 Public Surface Definition of Done
## Status
Extracted draft.
This file was extracted from an existing blueprint to separate execution workflow and DoD from planning blueprint content.
This file is not an implementation patch and does not mark any error log as fixed.

## Source
- `docs/blueprint/security/2026-05-06-adr-0020-public-surface-output-storage-attachment-blueprint.md`

## Extracted Sections
## DoD For Planning

Planning is complete only when:

- ADR-0020 exists
- ADR-0020 owner decisions are captured
- impacted error logs are mapped
- output contexts are defined
- URL policy is defined
- storage boundary is defined
- attachment serving policy is defined
- count/stat disclosure policy is defined
- deny-by-default rule is defined
- error response policy is defined
- route/surface inventory method is defined
- characterization test matrix is defined
- implementation order is defined
- CLI workflow is defined
- stop conditions are defined
- ADR-0019 access scope is not mixed into ADR-0020
- ADR-0018 finance scope is not mixed into ADR-0020
- payment concurrency is explicitly out of scope
- seeder credential safety is explicitly out of scope
- no application source patch is made during planning

## DoD For Implementation

Implementation is complete only when all relevant conditions for the selected slice are proven.

### Source Boundary

- public-surface behavior is enforced server-side where applicable
- UI hiding is not the only protection
- raw user-controlled HTML is not rendered
- JS config uses safe encoding
- return URL uses internal-relative allow-list or safe fallback
- private storage is not exposed through public helper
- attachment serving uses auth and policy
- file path is resolved from server-owned identifier
- path traversal is blocked
- MIME/content-type decision is server-owned
- unknown/risky attachment types are downloaded safely
- safe inline preview is limited to allowed image/PDF types
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is applied for attachment serving
- filename output is sanitized
- cashier global count is not leaked
- disclosure is deny-by-default when scope is unclear

### Tests

- red characterization test exists before patch
- targeted test fails before patch for expected reason
- targeted test passes after patch
- relevant blast-radius tests pass
- no unrelated tests are weakened
- no test is changed merely to hide a failure
- XSS payloads are tested with realistic payloads
- unsafe URLs are tested with realistic payloads
- storage/attachment tests prove authorization and safe headers where relevant
- disclosure tests prove response does not leak protected count/stat

### Documentation

- docs/error_log finding is updated only after proof
- ADR is not rewritten casually during implementation
- any deviation from ADR-0020 is recorded with reason
- any deviation from this blueprint is recorded with reason
- verification gap remains visible when proof is incomplete
- no finding is marked fixed from patch existence alone

### Git

- git status is checked before and after
- diff contains only files in approved slice
- commit message references the narrow fix
- owner reviews proof before commit
- no untracked unexpected file is left unreviewed

## ADR-0020 Blast-Radius Suite

After all ADR-0020 slices are complete, run the narrowest available blast-radius suite that covers:

- admin note views
- expense create/update views
- product return links
- supplier payment proof attachment serving
- cashier create page
- relevant Blade/view audits
- relevant security tests

Suggested command set must be selected after exact test files exist.

Minimum final proof should include:

- targeted tests per fixed error_log
- relevant feature suite pass
- static or grep audit for raw output/public helper patterns
- final git diff stat
- final docs/error_log updates
- owner acceptance

## Error Log Update Rule

Do not update `docs/error_log/*.md` before implementation proof.

When updating an error log, include:

- status
- exact patch scope
- tests added
- targeted command output
- blast-radius command output
- residual gaps
- commit hash after commit, if committed
- owner acceptance note if applicable

Allowed statuses:

- Reported
- Accepted risk
- Planned
- Patched with verification gap
- Fixed with proof
- Deferred with owner acceptance

Forbidden status behavior:

- marking fixed because a patch exists
- hiding missing test proof
- converting uncertainty into success language
- deleting known gap without evidence

## Stop Conditions

Stop immediately if any of these happen:

- source code contradicts ADR-0020 owner decisions
- test requires changing ADR-0019 access policy
- test requires changing ADR-0018 finance lifecycle
- patch requires payment allocation locking or concurrency semantics
- patch requires seeder credential changes
- patch relies only on Blade/JavaScript hiding
- patch renders raw user-controlled HTML
- patch trusts client MIME, filename, extension, path, URL, or count scope
- patch exposes private storage through public helper
- patch adds external redirect support without explicit allow-list ADR
- patch serves private attachment without auth/policy
- patch allows cashier global count without explicit rule
- failing test reason is not understood
- broad refactor is needed before exact affected files are proven
- diff grows beyond approved slice
- error_log update is attempted before proof
