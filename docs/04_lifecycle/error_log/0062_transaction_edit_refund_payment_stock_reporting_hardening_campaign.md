# 0062 - Transaction Edit Refund Payment Stock Reporting Hardening Campaign

## Status

In progress for the broader edit/refund/payment/stock/reporting campaign.

Sub-slices A-O are closed with automated proof.

## Context

This campaign extends the closed `0051` manual transaction reporting QA matrix with automated hardening for the highest-risk combined state-machine:

- edit/revision;
- refund;
- payment status;
- store-stock movement;
- reporting reconciliation.

The previous `0050` through `0061` inventory/reporting closure remains valid. This slice does not reopen inventory costing semantics, source type registry ownership, deleted/orphan reporting, or PDF/Excel deleted product parity.

## Hard Boundary

- Do not change costing engine.
- Do not change HPP movement creation.
- Do not change `inventory_value_rupiah` semantics.
- Do not add migration.
- Do not write production DB.
- Do not remove payment/refund/revision history.
- Do not change refund policy.
- Do not make refund act as edit.
- Do not make edit act as refund.
- Do not change master product price behavior.
- Do not change `inventory_movements.source_type` bucket membership.

## Problem

Existing tests covered important pieces separately:

- service-only paid upward revision and delta payment;
- store-stock revision reversal/reissue;
- paid downward revision surplus settlement;
- unpaid/open refund rejection;
- edit after refund preserving historical rows;
- package component refund/pay-again matrix;
- transaction/cash/inventory/profit reporting reconciliation.
- revision duplicate-submit idempotency;
- refund duplicate-submit idempotency;
- payment duplicate-submit idempotency.
- package component refund/edit/pay-again/report proof.
- external purchase/pass-through refund/edit/report proof.
- one-click edit/refund reason default UI proof.

The initial missing proof was a combined regression where a paid or unpaid store-stock transaction crosses edit, payment, refund guard, stock movement, and reports in one scenario. The later hardening added duplicate-submit protection for both revision and primary selected-row refund paths, including real UI hidden-key coverage.

Coverage:

- service with external purchase can be created without inventory movement;
- external purchase `package_auto_split` remains blocked until an explicit contract exists;
- selected-row refund for closed external purchase is default blocked;
- blocked external refund does not create customer refund, refund component allocation, or inventory movement;
- generic/selected-row refund policy does not refund `service_external_purchase_part` by default;
- service-fee-only correction keeps external purchase line intact;
- external purchase cost remains a case/pass-through cost in operational profit reporting;
- transaction cash, refund, external purchase cost, inventory, and profit reconciliation remain aligned in the golden master.

### 0062-N - One-click Edit/Refund Reason Default UI

Tests:

- `test_cashier_can_open_edit_workspace_page_for_unpaid_note_with_payment_modal_but_without_refund_action`
- `test_refund_modal_renders_idempotency_key_for_normal_submit`

Coverage:

- edit workspace renders an editable default reason: `Revisi nota via workspace`;
- edit workspace reason textarea is marked required in the UI;
- refund modal renders an editable default reason: `Pengembalian dana / pembatalan rincian`;
- refund modal still sends the existing idempotency key;
- direct backend refund request still rejects blank reason, so the audit policy remains strict.

### 0062-O - Cash/Transfer Delta Ledger Detail Hardening

Tests:

- `test_admin_transfer_payment_after_upward_revision_records_only_delta_without_cash_detail`
- `GetTransactionCashLedgerPerNoteFeatureTest`
- `TransactionCashLedgerExcelExportFeatureTest`

Coverage:

- paid note revised upward keeps the old payment preserved;
- transfer settlement after revision records only the outstanding delta;
- transfer settlement does not create `customer_payment_cash_details`;
- transaction cash ledger splits transfer delta into `transfer_in_rupiah`;
- cash ledger detail rows expose cash-only fields for cash payments;
- transfer and refund rows keep cash-only fields null;
- Excel detail export includes `Tunai Dibayar`, `Uang Pelanggan`, and `Kembalian Tunai`;
- no production patch was needed for transfer delta behavior after the regression test.

## Failing Test Proof

Initial 0062-A run failed before the report COGS production patch:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php
```

Observed failure:

```text
Failed asserting that 200000 is identical to 120000.

tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php:206
```

Meaning:

- inventory movement and transaction/payment assertions already passed;
- operational profit COGS counted both original and replacement store-stock `stock_out`;
- edit reversal `transaction_workspace_updated` was not offsetting store-stock COGS.

## Root Cause

`ProductCostMetricQuery::storeStockCogs()` subtracted refund reversals:

- `source_type = work_item_store_stock_line_reversal`

but did not subtract edit/revision reversal:

- `source_type = transaction_workspace_updated`

Dashboard operational performance had the same drift in `StoreStockCogsPerDayQuery`.

The inventory engine was not changed. The bug was report COGS interpretation of existing edit reversal movement.

Later 0062-B was tightened after owner policy clarification:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php --filter=paid_store_stock_revision_downward
```

Initial RED result:

```text
Failed asserting that two strings are not identical.

tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php:321
```

Meaning:

- paid downward revision created `overpaid_pending` settlement;
- but no `note_revision_surplus_dispositions` refund-due row was written;
- therefore the surplus existed only as a pending action, not as committed customer-money obligation.

After auto-settlement was added, the same test exposed a dashboard mismatch:

```text
Failed asserting that 270000 is identical to 170000.

tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php:440
```

Meaning:

- transaction report, cash ledger, and operational profit summary already read surplus refund paid correctly;
- dashboard refund aggregation still read only legacy `customer_refunds`;
- dashboard profit could still include returned surplus as profit.

0062-F duplicate-submit RED:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php --filter=duplicate_submit
```

Initial RED result:

```text
Failed asserting that 3 is identical to 2.

tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php:916
```

Meaning:

- repeating the same edit request created revision `r003`;
- duplicate submit could duplicate stock correction, settlement, refund_due, and refund_paid side effects;
- create workspace already had idempotency, but edit/revision submit did not.

0062-G edit UI RED:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/TransactionEditRefundPaymentStockReportingHardeningTest.php --filter=renders_revision_idempotency_key
```

Initial RED result:

```text
Expected response to contain: name="idempotency_key"
```

Meaning:

- backend revision idempotency was available only if a key was sent;
- normal edit UI did not send a key, so double-click protection was not active from the real form.

0062-H primary refund duplicate-submit RED:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/RecordClosedNoteRefundControllerFeatureTest.php --filter=duplicate_refund_submit
```

Initial RED result:

```text
Session has unexpected errors: Line yang sudah batal/refund tidak boleh dipilih lagi.
```

Meaning:

- first submit correctly created refund/cancel/reversal state;
- second same-key submit did not replay the completed operation;
- the request fell through into normal refund eligibility and failed against the already-canceled row;
- the stale error avoided duplicate refund rows in this fixture, but did not provide idempotent UX or a stored duplicate-submit contract.

0062-I refund modal UI RED:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/RecordClosedNoteRefundControllerFeatureTest.php --filter=refund_modal_renders_idempotency_key
```

Initial RED result:

```text
Expected response to contain: name="idempotency_key"
```

Meaning:

- backend refund idempotency would only work if a key was sent;
- normal refund modal UI did not send a key, so real double-click/back-button resubmit paths were not protected.

0062-J primary payment duplicate-submit RED:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/RecordNotePaymentHttpFeatureTest.php --filter=duplicate_payment_submit
```

Initial RED result:

```text
Hanya billing row outstanding yang boleh dipilih untuk pembayaran.
```

Meaning:

- first submit correctly created payment/allocation state;
- second same-key submit did not replay the completed operation;
- the request fell through into normal selected-row payment validation and failed against the already-paid row;
- the stale error avoided duplicate payment rows in this fixture, but did not provide idempotent UX or a stored duplicate-submit contract.

0062-K payment modal UI RED:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/CashierNoteDetailSimplePaymentModalUxFeatureTest.php --filter=detail_payment_modal_uses_simple_create_like_payment_flow
```

Initial RED result:

```text
Expected response to contain: name="idempotency_key"
```

Meaning:

- backend payment idempotency would only work if a key was sent;
- normal payment modal UI did not send a key, so real double-click/back-button resubmit paths were not protected.

- `resources/views/cashier/notes/partials/payment-modal.blade.php`

Patch behavior:

- store-stock COGS still counts `work_item_store_stock_line` stock_out;
- refund reversal still offsets COGS;
- edit/revision reversal `transaction_workspace_updated` now also offsets COGS;
- cross-period negative COGS behavior remains valid because existing tests still pass;
- paid downward revision surplus now creates refund-due and immediate surplus-refund-paid records inside the revision transaction;
- surplus auto-settlement writes canonical `audit_events` and keeps FK-backed audit links;
- cash ledger and dashboard refund aggregation both include `note_revision_surplus_refund_payments`;
- revision submit supports optional `idempotency_key` with operation `create_note_revision`;
- repeated same-key same-payload revision requests return the stored success result without mutating note, stock, settlement, refund_due, or refund_paid again;
- edit workspace page now emits a hidden idempotency key so normal UI submits activate the backend guard;
- selected-row refund submit supports optional `idempotency_key` with operation `record_selected_rows_refund`;
- repeated same-key same-payload selected-row refund requests replay success before stale canceled/refunded row checks;
- normal refund modal submits now emit a hidden idempotency key so backend duplicate-submit protection is active in the real UI path;
- customer payment submit supports optional `idempotency_key` with operation `record_note_payment`;
- repeated same-key same-payload payment requests replay success before stale already-paid row checks;
- normal payment modal submits now emit a hidden idempotency key so backend duplicate-submit protection is active in the real UI path;
- no inventory movement source type was renamed or re-bucketed.

## Financial And Stock Invariants Locked

- Refund is not edit.
- Edit is not refund.
- Paid edit upward creates outstanding delta; it does not erase old payment.
- Paid edit downward preserves old payment, creates refund-due, records default surplus refund paid, and does not treat surplus as profit.
- Duplicate paid downward edit submit does not create duplicate revision, stock correction, settlement, refund_due, or refund_paid rows.
- Normal edit form submits carry `idempotency_key`, so the backend duplicate-submit guard is active for real UI use.
- Duplicate selected-row refund submit does not create duplicate cash refund, component allocation, or stock reversal.
- Normal refund form submits carry `idempotency_key`, so the backend duplicate-submit guard is active for real UI use.
- Duplicate selected-row payment submit does not create duplicate cash-in, cash detail, or component allocation.
- Normal payment form submits carry `idempotency_key`, so the backend duplicate-submit guard is active for real UI use.
- Refunded package components remain historical/shadow and do not become current collectible debt after edit/replacement.
- Service package component refunds cannot be silently paid again without deliberate new stock-out.
- Service package profit breakdown remains tied to historical package/stock/refund sources after payment, price change, and revision.
- External purchase refunds remain default-blocked without a manual exception path.
- Blocked external purchase refunds do not mutate customer refund, refund allocation, or inventory movement tables.
- External purchase cost remains pass-through/case cost in reporting and does not become store-stock inventory movement.
- Edit/refund UI now provides editable default reasons while preserving strict backend reason validation.
- Unpaid note refund attempt is rejected.
- Refunded store-stock admin correction preserves payment/refund history.
- Master product price change does not rewrite historical transaction line value.
- Revision below current master minimum price is rejected without financial/stock side effects.
- Store-stock edit uses revision reversal/reissue, not refund reversal.
- Refund reversal remains `work_item_store_stock_line_reversal`.
- Edit reversal remains `transaction_workspace_updated`.
- Operational profit and dashboard COGS use net replacement COGS after edit reversal.
- Dashboard refund/profit reads surplus refund paid cash-out, not only legacy customer refunds.
- Transaction summary/cash ledger current report uses capped current allocations.
- Gross customer payment history remains preserved in `customer_payments`.
- Transfer payment after paid upward revision records only the outstanding delta.
- Transfer payment after paid upward revision does not create cash detail rows.
- Cash ledger splits cash-in and transfer-in while keeping cash-only received/change fields on cash rows.
