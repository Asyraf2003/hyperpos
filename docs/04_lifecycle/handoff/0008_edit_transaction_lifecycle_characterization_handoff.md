# Handoff - Edit Transaction Lifecycle Characterization

## Metadata

- Date: 2026-05-26
- Slice / topic: Phase 2 edit transaction lifecycle characterization, active revision route, rollback, store-stock inventory, refund current-row boundary, and closed-note edit policy
- Workflow step: Phase 2-01 through Phase 2-05 characterization
- Status: continue in next session
- Progress: Phase 2 characterization foundation GREEN; full verify still pending

## Target Work Page

Continue HyperPOS Phase 2 edit transaction lifecycle maturity.

This handoff records the completed characterization proofs for active edit/revision behavior after Phase 1 service-only create maturity closure.

The current target is to consolidate the Phase 2 focused suite, then run full verification before claiming broader Phase 2 closure.

## Locked Facts

- Phase 1 service-only create transaction maturity remains closed.
- UI/browser idempotency key delivery remains deferred.
- Active edit submit route is revision-based:
  - admin route: PATCH /admin/notes/{noteId}/workspace
  - cashier route: PATCH /cashier/notes/{noteId}/workspace
  - controller: app/Adapters/In/Http/Controllers/Note/StoreNoteRevisionController.php
  - request: app/Adapters/In/Http/Requests/Note/StoreNoteRevisionRequest.php
  - application entry: app/Application/Note/UseCases/CreateNoteRevisionHandler.php
- UpdateTransactionWorkspaceController and UpdateTransactionWorkspaceHandler exist but are not proven active production edit routes from routes/web/note.php.
- StoreNoteRevisionRequest forces inline_payment.decision to skip.
- Revision submit and payment submit remain separate flows.
- Admin route disables workspace editability enforcement in StoreNoteRevisionController.
- Cashier route keeps workspace editability enforcement and rejects closed note revision submit.
- Active revision workflow:
  - locks root note
  - resolves current revision
  - builds replacement note
  - builds revision settlement
  - applies active replacement
  - creates new revision
  - persists settlement
  - sets current revision pointer
  - records legacy audit note_revision_created
  - commits transaction
- ApplyNoteRevisionAsActiveReplacement:
  - captures payment allocation amounts
  - updates note header
  - deletes existing component payment allocations
  - persists replacement work items
  - updates note total
  - rebuilds payment allocations
  - syncs note_history_projection
- Store-stock revision path:
  - reverses previous issued inventory through transaction_workspace_updated reverse source type
  - deletes old current work item rows
  - creates replacement work items
  - issues inventory for replacement store-stock lines
- Refund after revision must use current replacement work item id, not stale historical work item id.
- note_history_projection is a fast current read model, not historical truth.
- Audit remains transitional:
  - revision still uses legacy AuditLogPort/audit_logs for note_revision_created
  - refund_due/refund_paid compatibility with audit_events was closed in earlier handoff
  - full audit unification is not part of this slice

## Scope Used

### SCOPE-IN

- Active note revision path.
- Rollback after active revision replacement side effects.
- Store-stock revision reversal/reissue lifecycle.
- Store-stock revision rollback after inventory side effects.
- Refund after revision current-row boundary.
- Admin vs cashier closed-note revision policy characterization.
- Focused adjacency verification for settlement, refund, rollback, inventory, and closed-note policy.

### SCOPE-OUT

- Production code patch.
- UI/browser QA.
- API/dashboard/seeder changes.
- Go API.
- PostgreSQL migration readiness.
- Report/export patch.
- Combined revision submit plus payment.
- Customer credit/customer balance entries.
- Full audit system unification.
- Git operations.

## GAP

- Full make verify has not been rerun after adding the Phase 2 characterization tests.
- Full consolidated Phase 2 focused suite has not yet been run in a single command.
- Browser/manual QA is not done.
- Report/export proof after edit/refund/revision is not complete.
- Full audit timeline/canonical audit contract for edit lifecycle remains transitional.
- Seeder cleanup/foundation remains deferred.
- PostgreSQL and Go readiness are not claimable.
- Performance target is not measured.
- No production bug was patched in this session because no RED production defect was produced.

## Locked Decisions

- Phase 2 edit transaction lifecycle work must target active revision route, not legacy UpdateTransactionWorkspaceHandler.
- Do not patch UpdateTransactionWorkspaceHandler unless route binding proof or dead-path cleanup decision exists.
- Keep revision submit and payment submit separate.
- Do not start with UI.
- Do not patch reports to hide settlement or projection mismatch.
- Store-stock revision must preserve inventory movement ledger correctness.
- Refund after revision must reject stale historical row id and accept current replacement row id.
- Admin can submit closed paid note revision through active admin revision route.
- Cashier cannot submit closed paid note revision through active cashier revision route.
- Phase 2 characterization foundation is GREEN through focused tests, but Phase 2 is not broadly closed until focused consolidation and make verify pass.

## Risks / Follow-up Notes

- The new tests are characterization tests, not production patches.
- Full project verification has not been run after these new tests.
- If make verify fails, treat the failure as the next active blocker.
- Do not claim Phase 2 broadly closed before full verification.
- Do not start report/API/Go/PostgreSQL work while verification status is unknown.
- Do not interpret admin closed-note revision as a general free-for-all; it is characterized as current active behavior and should later be documented or hardened by explicit policy/ADR if needed.
- Legacy UpdateTransactionWorkspaceHandler remains source-present but route-unproven.
- Edit/refund lifecycle is improving, but audit is still transitional.

## Next Step

Phase 2-06 - Consolidated Phase 2 focused verification.

Goal:

Run all Phase 2 characterization tests plus key adjacency tests in one focused command.

If focused suite is GREEN, run full make verify.

If focused suite or make verify is RED, stop and source-map the first failure only.

Do not patch production before RED proof.

Suggested focused command:

    php artisan test \
      tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionRollbackFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionStoreStockInventoryLifecycleFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionStoreStockRollbackFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/RefundAfterRevisionCurrentRowBoundaryFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/ClosedNoteRevisionPolicyFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionSettlementCarryForwardFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionRefundDueCarryForwardFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/CreateNoteRevisionSurplusRefundPaidCarryForwardFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/NoteReplacementOverpaidAllocationReplayFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/CashierServiceStoreStockReplacementBackdatedPriceFinanceFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/CashierClosedNoteWorkspaceReplacementSubmitFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/RecordClosedNoteRefundControllerFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Inventory/ReverseIssuedInventoryOperationFeatureTest.php

If focused command is GREEN, run:

    make verify
