# Service Catalog Lookup Migration Handoff

## Metadata
- Date: 2026-06-05
- Slice / topic: Cashier note service catalog lookup and migration backfill
- Workflow step: Service autocomplete defect closure and PostgreSQL-readiness documentation
- Status: Focused verified
- Progress: 100% for this slice

## Target Work Page
Cashier create/edit note workspace service-name autocomplete for service-only, service + store-stock product, and service + external product rows.

## References Used
- Blueprint: user request for service default pricing and mobile-centric cashier note workflow
- Workflow: AI_RULES one active step, proof-first execution
- DoD: endpoint works from actual development DB, default service master exists without manual seed, `make verify` green
- ADR: none created in this slice
- Previous handoff: `docs/04_lifecycle/handoff/0017_note_services_domain_rule_audit_handoff.md`
- Repo snapshot / command output:
  - `php artisan migrate`
  - development DB read for `service_catalog_items`
  - `php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/TransactionWorkspaceServiceCatalogSyncFeatureTest.php tests/Feature/Note/ServiceCatalogEndpointFeatureTest.php`
  - `make verify`

## Locked Facts
- The cashier UI service autocomplete initially did not show saved services in the browser because the development database did not yet have the `service_catalog_items` table.
- Route wiring existed before the DB fix:
  - `cashier.notes.services.lookup`
  - `cashier.notes.services.store`
  - `admin.notes.services.lookup`
  - `admin.notes.services.store`
- After running `php artisan migrate`, the development database had `12` `service_catalog_items` rows.
- Default service rows include `Sok Kopling (Besar)`, `Sok Kopling (Kecil)`, setting in/ex variants, bosklep in/ex variants, and pasang stang variants.
- Service lookup supports:
  - full normalized query such as `sok kopling besar`
  - partial token query such as `sok besar`
  - query-less open/focus list for saved service names
- `sok kopling besar` and `sok kopling (besar)` normalize to the same key, `sok kopling besar`.

## Scope Used
### SCOPE-IN
- Service catalog table creation.
- Default service master backfill.
- Cashier/admin service lookup endpoints.
- Create/edit note workspace service autocomplete behavior.
- Documentation for migration and handoff.

### SCOPE-OUT
- Go Echo API implementation.
- PostgreSQL cutover.
- Live MySQL data export/import.
- Full DB parity harness.
- Changing financial transaction source-of-truth tables.

## GAP
- PostgreSQL production cutover is not proven by this slice.
- There is no completed PostgreSQL runtime test suite proof in this slice.
- Live MySQL to PostgreSQL transition still needs row-count parity, rupiah reconciliation, inventory reconciliation, audit/projection rebuild proof, and rollback runbook.

## Locked Decisions
- Default service names belong in `service_catalog_items`, not hardcoded only in JavaScript.
- Missing service catalog rows are created idempotently when service names are used in create/edit note flows.
- Existing catalog default prices are not overwritten by cashier-entered prices during transaction entry.
- The transaction remains the financial source of truth; service catalog is only a default/suggestion source.
- A forward migration backfills the 12 default service rows so existing development/live-like MySQL databases do not depend on manual seeding.

## Verification Proof
- command:
  - `php artisan migrate`
  - result: `2026_06_04_000100_create_service_catalog_items_table` and `2026_06_04_000200_seed_default_service_catalog_items` ran successfully.
  - meaning: development database has the table and default rows needed by browser lookup.
- command:
  - development DB read for `service_catalog_items`
  - result: count `12`, sample rows included `Pasang Stang (Kecil)`, `Bosklep In (Besar)`, `Sok Kopling (Besar)`, `Setting In (Kecil)`, `Setting Ex (Kecil)`.
  - meaning: the browser endpoint is no longer blocked by a missing table or missing default data.
- command:
  - `php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/TransactionWorkspaceServiceCatalogSyncFeatureTest.php tests/Feature/Note/ServiceCatalogEndpointFeatureTest.php`
  - result: `9 passed (26 assertions)`.
  - meaning: lookup, default list, partial token matching, create-if-missing, and non-overwrite behavior are covered.
- command:
  - `make verify`
  - result: `2 skipped, 1167 passed (6581 assertions)`.
  - meaning: repository verification is green after the migration and documentation slice.

## PostgreSQL Migration Assessment
- The new `service_catalog_items` table migration uses portable Laravel schema-builder primitives:
  - string primary key
  - string unique normalized name
  - integer rupiah default price
  - boolean active flag
  - timestamps
- The default data migration uses Laravel query builder and `Str::uuid()`, not MySQL-only SQL.
- No new MySQL-only constructs were introduced:
  - no unsigned integer
  - no enum
  - no `after()`
  - no `change()`
  - no raw MySQL DDL
  - no auto-increment domain identity
- Allowed claim: this service catalog slice is PostgreSQL-aligned as a fresh-schema migration.
- Forbidden claim: the full application is PostgreSQL production-cutover ready.

## Risks / Follow-up Notes
- Browser may need a hard refresh if stale `service-catalog.js` is cached.
- If a deployed environment already ran the create-table migration but not the default-data migration, run pending migrations normally, not `migrate:fresh`.
- Future PostgreSQL cutover still requires dedicated parity proof outside this slice.

## Next Step
If the owner wants to continue DB hardening, the next valid step is PostgreSQL compatibility classification for remaining migrations or a PostgreSQL test harness dry-run, not Go API implementation yet.

## Session Update - 0052 Inventory Average Cost Rounding Residual Visibility

### Status

PATCHED - dataset-level diagnostic visibility proof PASS.

### Context

Previous slice `0051` fixed the costing projection engine mismatch.

Remaining value gap is true integer average-cost rounding residual:

```text
rounding_residual = inventory_value_rupiah - (avg_cost_rupiah * qty_on_hand)
```

Known post-rebuild residual:

```text
prod-year-001: 3
prod-year-006: 23
total residual: 26
```

### Files Changed

- `app/Adapters/Out/Reporting/InventoryCurrentSnapshotDatabaseQuery.php`
- `app/Adapters/Out/Reporting/InventoryCurrentSnapshotRowMapper.php`
- `app/Application/Reporting/Services/InventoryStockValueReportSummaryBuilder.php`
- `tests/Feature/Reporting/GetInventoryStockValueReportDatasetFeatureTest.php`
- `docs/04_lifecycle/error_log/0052_inventory_average_cost_rounding_residual_visibility.md`

### Acceptance Proof

Owner reported:

```text
GetInventoryStockValueReportDatasetFeatureTest PASS
all relevant tests PASS
```

### Boundary

- No costing engine change.
- No HPP change.
- No aggressive main report value change.
- Dataset now separates ledger mismatch from rounding residual.

### Next

Continue with export/UI diagnostic visibility only after this handoff is committed.
