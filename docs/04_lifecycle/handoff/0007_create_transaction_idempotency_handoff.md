# Handoff - Create Transaction Idempotency And Phase 1 Closure

## Metadata

- Date: 2026-05-25
- Slice / topic: Create transaction maturity, duplicate-submit idempotency, rollback proof, and Phase 1 closure preparation
- Workflow step: Phase 1F-10D create workspace idempotency implementation
- Status: continue in next session
- Progress: 98%

## Target Work Page

Continue final Phase 1 closure for create transaction maturity.

The current target is to close the last create-transaction idempotency verification gaps, then run full verification and update lifecycle status.

## Original Goal Reminder

The broad project goals are:

1. Create transaction mature enough to support future edit and refund.
2. Edit transaction lifecycle maturity.
3. Refund lifecycle maturity.
4. Clean/auditable audit flow.
5. Clean seeder foundation.

Current work is still inside goal 1.

Do not jump to edit/refund production implementation before Phase 1 closure proof is complete.

## Source Priority Used

1. Local command output from operator.
2. Current source code.
3. Latest blueprint / ADR nearest to domain.
4. Error log with proof.
5. Existing handoff with proof.
6. Older archived handoff.
7. Assumption, only when explicitly marked.

## Implementation Summary

### Idempotency migration

Table:

`idempotency_records`

Purpose:

- persist actor + operation + idempotency key state
- persist request hash
- persist success result reference
- prevent duplicate create transaction submits

Important fields:

- actor_id
- operation
- idempotency_key
- request_hash
- status
- response_type
- result_note_id
- result_payload_json
- locked_at
- completed_at
- expires_at

Unique scope:

- actor_id + operation + idempotency_key

Reason:

Backend must own financial duplicate prevention. Browser debounce/session-only handling is not sufficient.

### Idempotency behavior

Current implemented behavior:

- no idempotency key:
  - legacy behavior remains
  - duplicate submit still creates duplicate notes
  - this is intentionally preserved as characterization/backward compatibility

- same actor + same operation + same key + same payload:
  - second submit replays/no-ops safely
  - only one note/payment/allocation/projection is created

- same actor + same operation + same key + different payload:
  - second submit is rejected as workspace error
  - no second note/payment/allocation/projection is created

### Handler integration

CreateTransactionWorkspaceHandler now:

1. checks replay before transaction
2. starts DB transaction
3. starts idempotency processing row if key exists
4. creates note/items/payment/audit/projection
5. marks idempotency succeeded with result payload
6. commits
7. rolls back on DomainException/Throwable

### Request/controller integration

StoreTransactionWorkspaceRules now accepts optional:

`idempotency_key`

StoreTransactionWorkspaceController now injects:

`_actor_id`

into handler payload when authenticated actor exists.

## GAP

### Remaining Phase 1 gaps

- Full `make verify` has not been rerun after the idempotency implementation.
- Failed attempt retry behavior is not yet proven:
  - forced failure with idempotency key
  - rollback
  - retry same key and same payload without failure
  - exactly one successful note
- Same-key concurrent request behavior is not truly proven.
- Store-stock/inventory create lifecycle is not characterized.
- Store-stock/inventory rollback is not characterized.
- Browser/manual QA is not done.
- Seeder cleanup is not started.

### Known design caveat

Current idempotency implementation stores the idempotency processing row inside the same DB transaction as the create transaction.

If failure occurs and transaction rolls back, the processing row also rolls back.

This is acceptable for retry allowance, but failed-attempt retry still needs explicit test proof.

### Not yet production-grade for all create variants

The mature proof currently centers on service-only create transaction lifecycle.

Store-stock/inventory lifecycle remains a separate Phase 1 gap.

## ASSUMPTION

### A1 - Optional idempotency key is acceptable for first implementation

Assumption:

`idempotency_key` remains optional for first slice.

Reason:

Existing create tests and legacy flow should remain compatible.

Risk:

Browser form can still submit without key unless UI later always includes it.

Containment:

Later UI/form slice should generate and include idempotency key by default.

### A2 - First replay response can use same redirect target with an already-processed message

Assumption:

For Blade create workspace, safe replay/no-op with redirect is acceptable.

Reason:

The current controller returns redirect to cashier notes index after success.

Risk:

User messaging may need refinement.

Containment:

Future UX pass can adjust success message wording without changing backend idempotency invariant.

### A3 - Same-key concurrency is deferred

Assumption:

First implementation can close sequential duplicate submit before true concurrency testing.

Reason:

Current proven production issue is duplicate sequential submit.

Risk:

Two same-key requests racing before the first commit may still need stronger locking behavior.

Containment:

Keep concurrency listed as explicit GAP.

## DECISION

- Phase 1 create maturity is near closure but not closed.
- Do not move into edit/refund production implementation until Phase 1 has a final closure proof or owner explicitly accepts remaining gaps.
- Next active step should be failed-attempt retry proof or full `make verify`.
- Recommended next active step is failed-attempt retry idempotency proof because it validates rollback interaction with the new idempotency table.
- After failed-attempt retry proof, run full `make verify`.
- Store-stock/inventory create lifecycle may be deferred or selected explicitly as the final Phase 1 domain gap.

## Recommended Next Step

Phase 1F-10E - Idempotency failed-attempt retry characterization.

Goal:

Prove that an idempotent create workspace attempt that fails after inline payment writes rolls back cleanly and can be retried with the same idempotency key and same payload.

Expected test target:

`tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceDuplicateSubmitFeatureTest.php`

Expected scenario:

1. Bind fake AuditLogPort that throws on `payment_allocated`.
2. Submit create workspace payload with `idempotency_key`.
3. Assert forced exception and rollback.
4. Rebind normal or no-op AuditLogPort.
5. Submit same payload with same `idempotency_key`.
6. Assert exactly one successful note/payment/allocation/projection.
7. Assert idempotency_records has exactly one succeeded row.

Do not patch production first.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before broad implementation if:

- same-key failed retry leaves stale `processing` row
- same-key retry creates duplicate note
- same-key different-payload behavior regresses
- full create lifecycle tests regress
- migration fails on fresh database
- fix requires touching edit/refund/payment-after-note flows
- fix relies on browser debounce as financial truth

## Next Verification Commands

Run targeted first:

    php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceDuplicateSubmitFeatureTest.php

Run focused adjacent:

    php artisan test \
      tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceDuplicateSubmitFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceRollbackFeatureTest.php \
      tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceInlinePaymentLifecycleFeatureTest.php

Run migration proof if DB structure changes:

    php artisan migrate:fresh

Run full verification before Phase 1 closure:

    make verify

# Phase 1F-10G Closure Boundary Update

## Date

2026-05-25

## Status

Phase 1 service-only create transaction maturity is CLOSED with explicit deferred gaps.

## Closure Scope

### Closed inside Phase 1 service-only create maturity

- Store-stock/inventory create lifecycle characterization.
- Store-stock/inventory rollback characterization.
- Seeder cleanup.

## Latest Proof

- command:
  - php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceDuplicateSubmitFeatureTest.php tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceRollbackFeatureTest.php tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceInlinePaymentLifecycleFeatureTest.php
- result:
  - Tests: 10 passed (158 assertions)
  - Duration: 6.90s
- meaning:
  - Focused duplicate-submit, idempotency retry, rollback, and inline payment lifecycle suite is GREEN.

- command:
  - make verify
- result:
  - PHPStan: 1736/1736, no errors
  - audit-lines: SUCCESS
  - Blade PHP/directive audit: SUCCESS
  - Contract audit: passed
  - Pest: 2 skipped, 1102 passed (6077 assertions)
  - Duration: 55.39s
- meaning:
  - Full project verification is GREEN after idempotency and split-file remediation.

## Files Added During Closure Remediation

- app/Application/Note/Services/CreateTransactionWorkspaceIdempotencyScopeResolver.php
- app/Application/Note/Services/CreateTransactionWorkspaceResultBuilder.php

## Files Changed During Closure Remediation

- app/Application/Note/UseCases/CreateTransactionWorkspaceHandler.php
- app/Application/Note/Services/CreateTransactionWorkspaceIdempotencyService.php
- tests/Feature/Note/CreateTransactionWorkspaceDuplicateSubmitFeatureTest.php

## Locked Decision

- Phase 1 create maturity closure applies to the service-only create transaction lifecycle.
- Remaining concurrency, store-stock/inventory, and seeder cleanup gaps are explicitly deferred.
- Do not reopen Phase 1 service-only create maturity unless a regression appears in focused tests or full verify.

## Recommended Next Step

Choose one next branch explicitly:

1. Phase 1G - store-stock/inventory create lifecycle characterization.
2. Phase 1H - true same-key concurrency proof.
3. Seeder cleanup foundation.
4. Phase 2 - edit transaction lifecycle maturity, only if owner accepts the deferred Phase 1 gaps.

- partial cash payment create flow: PASS
- full transfer payment create flow: PASS
- partial transfer payment create flow: PASS
- browser form idempotency key wiring: PASS

Browser form proof:

Deferred Gaps

These are explicitly deferred and do not block Phase 1 service-only create maturity closure:

true same-key concurrency proof
store-stock/inventory create lifecycle characterization
store-stock/inventory rollback characterization
seeder cleanup
Locked Closure Decision

Phase 1 service-only create transaction maturity is closed at 100%.

Next phase may start from Phase 2 edit transaction lifecycle maturity, starting with blueprint/readiness review before implementation.

# Phase 1F-10I UI Idempotency Wiring Reversal

## Date

2026-05-25

## Status

UI idempotency key wiring was removed by owner decision.

## FACT

- Backend create workspace idempotency remains implemented and proven by automated tests.
- Browser form no longer sends `idempotency_key` by default.
- Normal UI submits are expected not to create `idempotency_records`.
- Manual browser idempotency proof from Phase 1F-10H is superseded for UI wiring only.

## Locked Decision

- Do not expose `idempotency_key` in create workspace Blade form.
- Treat UI/browser idempotency as deferred.
- Keep backend idempotency contract and tests intact.

## Closure Meaning

Phase 1 service-only create transaction maturity remains closed for backend/service lifecycle and manual A-E create flows.

The following are explicitly deferred:

- UI/browser idempotency key delivery
- true same-key concurrency proof
- store-stock/inventory create lifecycle characterization
- store-stock/inventory rollback characterization
- seeder cleanup

## Next Step

Phase 2 may start only with the above deferred gaps acknowledged.
