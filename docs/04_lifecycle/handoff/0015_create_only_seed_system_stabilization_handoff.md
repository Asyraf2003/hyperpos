# CreateOnly Seed System Stabilization Handoff

## Status

Active handoff.

This handoff records CreateOnly seed system stabilization for manual QA and owner-readable reporting preparation.

This handoff does not close the full seed system.

## Source Of Truth

- Active seed scale blueprint: docs/03_blueprints/seeder/0001_create_only_seed_scale_profiles.md

Local command output is the highest source of truth.

Do not claim a seed, report, projection, test, or verify status without local proof.

Do not discuss git workflow unless explicitly requested.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Stabilize human-facing create-all seed command.
- Ensure source seed rows appear in read-model projections.
- Move existing CreateOnly seed dates into the active month.
- Add a minimal weekly create transaction seed through the real create transaction use case.
- Prepare next report sanity step before scaling dataset.

### Out Of Scope For Current State

- Edit/revision seeding.
- Soft delete seeding.
- Refund seeding, except future disabled/pending scaffold.
- Monthly 100-200 juta dataset.
- Peak 500 juta/month dataset.
- Stress 6-8 miliar/month dataset.
- Report wording patch.
- Full lifecycle closure.

## Completed Work

### SEED-INFRA-001 - Human-facing create-all projection rebuild

Human-facing create-all-v3 now runs:

- source seed
- audit baseline
- projection rebuild all

Relevant target behavior was proven by dry-run output containing:

- Database\Seeders\CreateOnly\CreateTransactionWeekSeeder
- Database\Seeders\CreateOnly\CreateAuditBaselineSeeder
- php artisan projection:rebuild-indexes all

Raw seed-create-all-v3 remains source-only/debug style.

### SEED-PROJECTION-001 - Procurement projection drift resolved

Problem:

- supplier_invoices source rows existed.
- supplier_invoice_list_projection had only partial/manual rows.
- procurement/faktur UI read projection, not source table.

Manual proof showed projection rebuild fixed source-to-projection visibility.

Final create-all-v3 now rebuilds projections automatically.

### SEED-DATE-001 - CreateOnly active-month calendar helper

Added helper:

- database/seeders/CreateOnly/Support/CreateOnlySeedCalendar.php

Purpose:

- avoid hardcoded 2026-05 dates.
- use active current month dates.
- allow next-month due dates where appropriate.

Applied to:

- database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateSupplierProcurementSeeder.php
- database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateOperationalExpenseSeeder.php
- database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreatePayrollDisbursementSeeder.php
- database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateEmployeeDebtSeeder.php
- database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateEmployeeDebtPaymentSeeder.php
- database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateEmployeeDebtAdjustmentSeeder.php

### SEED-DATE-002 - Non-transaction active-month sanity proof

Local sanity output after the date fixes:

supplier_invoices_june = 24
supplier_payments_june = 24
operational_expenses_june = 45
payroll_june = 6
employee_debts_june = 13
employee_debt_payments_june = 6
employee_debt_adjustments_june = 3
notes = 0

Meaning:

- non-transaction source seed is now aligned with June 2026.
- create transaction seed was still absent at that proof point.

### SEED-TXN-001 - Minimal weekly create transaction seed

Added file:

- database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateTransactionWeekSeeder.php

Wired make target:

- seed-transaction-week

Wired into:

- seed-create-all-v3

Implementation decision:

- Create note seed must use App\Application\Note\UseCases\CreateTransactionWorkspaceHandler.
- Do not raw-insert notes/work_items/payments/projections.

Reason:

CreateTransactionWorkspaceHandler performs the real mutation path:

- idempotency replay/start/succeed
- transaction begin/commit/rollback
- note creation
- work item persistence
- inventory issue for store stock lines
- note total update
- inline payment recording
- payment component allocations
- audit log
- note history projection sync

### SEED-TXN-002 - Weekly transaction seed final local proof

Command:

php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
make create-all-v3

Then tinker count proof.

Final local output:

create-only transaction week notes: planned=6 created=6 replayed=0

Projection rebuild output:

Procurement projection: 24/24
Supplier projection: 78/78
Note projection: 6/6

Final counts:

notes = 6
work_items = 6
work_item_service_details = 6
work_item_store_stock_lines = 3
work_item_external_purchase_lines = 2
customer_payments = 5
payment_component_allocations = 9
inventory_stock_out_for_work_items = 3
note_history_projection = 6
transaction_note_totals.total_notes = 6
transaction_note_totals.total_rupiah = 1225000
external_package_note.customer_name = Seed Customer Mingguan 006
external_package_note.total_rupiah = 275000

Interpretation:

- weekly transaction seed is GREEN at minimal level.
- 6 notes were created through the real create transaction handler.
- note projection rebuild is GREEN.
- store stock inventory issue path is covered.
- external purchase path is covered.
- package auto split store-stock multi-product path is covered.
- external package path is covered.
- inline payment path is covered.
- 5 payments are expected because one note intentionally skips payment.

### SEED-TXN-003 - Monthly-normal create transaction seed

Added files:

- `database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateTransactionMonthNormalSeeder.php`
- `database/seeders/CreateOnly/Support/CreateTransactionMonthNormalPayloadFactory.php`
- `database/seeders/CreateOnly/Support/CreateTransactionMonthNormalItemFactory.php`

Changed file:

- `mk/seed.mk`

Implementation decision:

- Keep `CreateTransactionWeekSeeder` as minimal weekly characterization seed.
- Add separate monthly-normal transaction seed instead of overloading weekly seed.
- Monthly-normal seed must still use `App\Application\Note\UseCases\CreateTransactionWorkspaceHandler`.
- Do not raw-insert notes, work_items, customer_payments, or projections.

Standalone operational profit proof after monthly-normal seed:

```text
notes_count = 34
notes_total_sum = 28125000
customer_payments_sum = 26650000
external_purchase_lines_sum = 1720000
store_stock_cogs_stock_out_sum = 229248
cash_operational_profit_rupiah = 6863252
```

Interpretation:

Monthly-normal seed changes operational profit from negative to positive without patching the reporting query.
Monthly-normal seed is owner-readable for June 2026 report sanity.
Weekly seed remains available as small characterization coverage.

### REPORT-SANITY-001 - Clean create-all-v3 aggregate proof after monthly-normal seed

Local command sequence:

```text
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
make create-all-v3
php artisan tinker --execute='... operational profit sanity query ...'
```

Visible local output from make create-all-v3:

```text
create-only transaction week notes: planned=6 created=6 replayed=0
create-only transaction month-normal notes: planned=28 created=28 replayed=0
Procurement projection: 24/24
Supplier projection: 78/78
Note projection: 34/34
Projection rebuild selesai.
```

Aggregate sanity output:

```text

payroll_disbursement_rupiah = 7525000
employee_debt_cash_out_rupiah = 7050000
cash_operational_profit_rupiah = 6863252
```

Interpretation:

make create-all-v3 now creates weekly + monthly-normal transaction seeds.
Note projection rebuild is aligned: 34/34.
Operational profit sanity is positive after aggregate seed.

### SEED-TXN-004 - Monthly-normal 100M transaction seed profile

Added files:

- `database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateTransactionMonthNormal100MSeeder.php`
- `database/seeders/CreateOnly/Support/CreateTransactionMonthNormal100MPayloadFactory.php`
- `database/seeders/CreateOnly/Support/CreateTransactionMonthNormal100MItemFactory.php`

Changed file:

- `mk/seed.mk`

Implementation decision:

- Keep `CreateTransactionMonthNormalSeeder` as the existing small owner-readable sanity profile.
- Add separate `CreateTransactionMonthNormal100MSeeder` as the monthly normal 100-200 juta profile.
- Do not mutate `seed-create-all-v3`.
- Add separate make targets:
  - `seed-transaction-month-normal-100m`
  - `seed-create-all-month-normal-100m`
  - `create-all-month-normal-100m`
- 100M profile still uses `App\Application\Note\UseCases\CreateTransactionWorkspaceHandler`.
- Do not raw-insert notes, work_items, customer_payments, or projections.

## Bugs Encountered And Resolved

### BUG-001 - Role constant mismatch

Failure:

Undefined constant App\Core\IdentityAccess\Role\Role::CASHIER

Cause:

Role class has Role::KASIR, not Role::CASHIER.

Fix:

Use Role::KASIR.

### BUG-002 - External package component amount zero

Failure:

Create transaction week seed failed: Amount komponen harus > 0.

Cause:

External package auto-split composer expects external_purchase_lines.0.total_rupiah for package mode.
Payload using qty/unit_cost without total_rupiah did not trigger package residual composition.

Fix:

External package payload must provide total_rupiah for package auto split external purchase.

Final proof after fix is GREEN.

## Current Progress Estimate

Existing CreateOnly seed stabilization:

99%

Reason:

human-facing create-all-v3 is wired and locally proven.
weekly transaction seed remains GREEN.
monthly-normal transaction seed is added and locally proven.
operational profit sanity is positive for June 2026.
PDF/XLSX operational profit report artifacts are locally proven.
full make verify is GREEN.

Monthly normal 100-200 juta profile:

100%

Reason:

standalone monthly-normal 100M transaction seed is locally proven.
aggregate create-all-month-normal-100m is locally proven.
cash-in is Rp 167.250.000.
note projection is aligned at 124/124.
operational profit sanity is positive at Rp 112.083.028.
PDF/XLSX export proof is locally proven.
test suite remains GREEN after the change.

Full serious create-all seed system:

84-86%

Reason full system is not higher:

peak 500 juta/month dataset is not implemented.
stress 6-8 miliar/month dataset is not implemented.
refund scaffold is not implemented.
full lifecycle closure is not done.

## GAP

No peak 500 juta/month dataset.
No stress 6-8 miliar/month dataset.
No refund scaffold.
No full lifecycle closure.

## DECISION

Do not patch operational profit reporting query.

Reason:

operational profit arithmetic was locally proven consistent.
the earlier negative result was caused by transaction seed size being too small versus monthly fixed/cash-out seed.
monthly-normal transaction seed made the report positive without modifying report logic.
monthly-normal 100M profile also produced positive report output without modifying report logic.

Keep CreateTransactionWeekSeeder as minimal weekly characterization seed.

Keep CreateTransactionMonthNormalSeeder as the June 2026 owner-readable small sanity profile.

Use CreateTransactionMonthNormal100MSeeder as the June 2026 monthly normal 100-200 juta profile.

Keep create-all-v3 unchanged.

Use create-all-month-normal-100m for the monthly normal 100-200 juta aggregate profile.

Do not start peak, stress, or refund scaffold in the same step as the 100M profile.

external_purchase_lines_total = 78
notes_total_sum = 604140000
customer_payments_sum = 550265000
```

Interpretation:

Peak 500M transaction seed is implemented.
Standalone seed is replay-safe after removing mutable qty_on_hand >= 20 product selection.
Aggregate profile reaches Rp 550.265.000 cash-in.
Note projection is aligned at 314/314.
Blueprint expected values differed by Rp 15.000; local output is source of truth.

### REPORT-SANITY-003 - Peak 500M operational profit sanity, not closed

Local handler-based output:

```text
success = true
notes = 314
work_items = 314
customer_payments = 295
note_history_projection = 314
from_date = 2026-06-01
to_date = 2026-06-30
cash_in_rupiah = 550265000
refunded_rupiah = 0
external_purchase_cost_rupiah = 99720000
store_stock_cogs_rupiah = 13954444
product_purchase_cost_rupiah = 113674444
operational_expense_rupiah = 0
payroll_disbursement_rupiah = 0
employee_debt_cash_out_rupiah = 0
cash_operational_profit_rupiah = 436590556
```

Interpretation:

Peak report handler returns positive cash operational profit.
Peak cash-in is above 500 juta.
However, non-transaction cash-out values are zero:

```text
operational_expense_rupiah = 0
payroll_disbursement_rupiah = 0
employee_debt_cash_out_rupiah = 0
```

This differs from the earlier 100M profile proof, where fixed cash-out values were present.
Peak report sanity is therefore not fully closed until this ambiguity is investigated.

### VERIFY-003 - Full verification after peak 500M changes

Local command:

```text
make verify
```

Visible local output:

```text
phpstan: [OK] No errors
audit-lines: SUCCESS
Blade PHP audit: SUCCESS
Contract audit passed
Tests: 2 skipped, 1140 passed (6466 assertions)
Duration: 82.39s
```

Interpretation:

Static analysis, audits, and test suite remain green after peak 500M changes.

### PR-PEAK-001 - Investigate zero non-transaction cash-out in peak report sanity

Problem:

Peak 500M operational profit sanity returned:

```text
operational_expense_rupiah = 0
payroll_disbursement_rupiah = 0
employee_debt_cash_out_rupiah = 0
```

But earlier 100M profile proof returned non-zero fixed cash-out values.

This may mean one of:

- peak aggregate command did not include non-transaction source seed in the actual local run;
- non-transaction rows exist but their dates do not fall into 2026-06-01 through 2026-06-30;
- report handler filters a different operational date field than expected;
- local DB state used for report sanity does not match the intended full aggregate state.

Required next proof:

Count and sum operational expenses, payroll disbursements, and employee debt payments by date.
Compare source-table values against GetOperationalProfitSummaryHandler output.
Decide whether seed date alignment or aggregate target dependency needs patching.

### PR-PEAK-002 - Clarify productless notes / service-only seed shape

Question raised:

Create nota may be understood as always taking products, but current create transaction seed supports productless notes for service-only and external-purchase flows.

Current interpretation:

A note with service-only work item and blank product_lines is technically valid.
A note with external purchase may have blank store-stock product_lines but non-empty external_purchase_lines.
Store-stock and package rows are the product-backed flows.

Open decision:

Confirm whether owner-readable peak dataset may contain productless service-only notes.
If productless notes confuse UI/report review, adjust seed mix or add clearer owner-readable labeling.
Do not treat productless notes as a runtime bug until the domain expectation is explicitly locked.

Required next proof:

Query peak notes by item shape:

- service-only count;
- store-stock count;
- external purchase count;
- package count;
- notes with no store-stock product line;
- notes with neither store-stock nor external purchase.

Decide whether the peak profile remains valid or needs seed-shape adjustment.

## Active Blueprint Promotion

Peak/stress scale planning was promoted from chat-only planning into:

docs/03_blueprints/seeder/0001_create_only_seed_scale_profiles.md

Purpose:

keep create-only seed scale profiles auditable outside the chat session;
preserve existing small and 100M profile proof;
define peak 500 juta/month as the next implementation target;
reserve stress 6-8 miliar/month and 10 miliar/month as separate future targets;
avoid mixing refund scaffold into create-only scale profile work.

Current blueprint status:

L0 create-all-v3: implemented/proven
L1 create-all-month-normal-100m: implemented/proven
L2 create-all-month-peak-500m: planned next
L3 create-all-month-stress-8b: planned later
L4 create-all-month-stress-10b: planned later
L5 refund scaffold: planned separately


## NEXT ACTIVE STEP

Investigate peak 500M report and seed-shape ambiguity.

Goal:

Close PR-PEAK-001 by proving why non-transaction cash-out is zero in peak report sanity.
Close or classify PR-PEAK-002 by proving whether productless notes are valid owner-readable seed rows.
Do not continue to PDF/XLSX export proof until the ambiguity is classified.

Scope:

Query source tables for operational expenses, payroll disbursements, and employee debt payments by date.
Query peak note/work item shape distribution.
Compare source rows against GetOperationalProfitSummaryHandler output.
Decide whether peak seed shape or aggregate target needs patching.

Do not start stress 6-8 miliar/month, 10 miliar/month, refund scaffold, or report wording patch in the same step.

Baca handoff aktif:

docs/04_lifecycle/handoff/0015_create_only_seed_system_stabilization_handoff.md

Cara kerja wajib:

Local command output adalah source of truth tertinggi.
Jangan mengarang file, status repo, hasil test, atau hasil command.
Gunakan struktur FACT / REFERENCES / SCOPE-IN / SCOPE-OUT / GAP / DECISION / BLUEPRINT / WORKFLOW / ACTIVE STEP / PROOF / NEXT / PROGRESS.
Blueprint-first sebelum implementasi.
Satu response hanya satu active step.
Jangan patch sebelum active scope jelas.
Jangan bahas git kecuali diminta eksplisit.

Status terakhir yang sudah terbukti dan tercatat:

CreateOnly seed stabilization progress: 99%.
Monthly normal 100-200 juta profile: 100%.
Full serious create-all seed system progress: 80-82%.

Mulai dari NEXT ACTIVE STEP di handoff:

Investigate peak 500M report and seed-shape ambiguity.

Target sesi berikutnya:

Baca active blueprint:
docs/03_blueprints/seeder/0001_create_only_seed_scale_profiles.md
Jangan patch make target dulu.
Patch hanya tiga file peak 500M seeder/factory:
database/seeders/CreateOnly/CreateTransactionMonthPeak500MSeeder.php
database/seeders/CreateOnly/Support/CreateTransactionMonthPeak500MPayloadFactory.php
database/seeders/CreateOnly/Support/CreateTransactionMonthPeak500MItemFactory.php
Jalankan syntax dan line-count proof.
Jangan mulai stress 6-8 miliar/month, 10 miliar/month, refund scaffold, atau report wording patch di step yang sama.
Setelah 3 file peak seeder valid, baru next response boleh wire make target.

### PEAK-500M-CLOSURE-001 - Peak 500M PR classification and export proof

Local date: 2026-06-02.

Scope:

- Close PR-PEAK-001.
- Close PR-PEAK-002.
- Prove peak 500M operational profit PDF/XLSX export.
- Do not start stress 6-8B.
- Do not start 10B.
- Do not start refund scaffold.

#### PR-PEAK-001 classification

Problem:

Peak 500M report sanity previously returned zero fixed cash-out:

```text
operational_expense_rupiah = 0
payroll_disbursement_rupiah = 0
employee_debt_cash_out_rupiah = 0
```

Investigation result:

The first probe showed the DB state had transaction rows but no non-transaction source rows:

```text
notes = 314
customer_payments = 295
operational_expenses = 0
payroll_disbursements = 0
employee_debts = 0
employee_debt_payments = 0
```

Make target inspection showed seed-create-all-month-peak-500m already depends on:

```text
seed-create-all-v3
seed-transaction-month-peak-500m
```

and seed-create-all-v3 already depends on the non-transaction seeds:

```text
seed-expense
seed-employee-debt
seed-employee-debt-payment
seed-employee-debt-adjustment
seed-payroll-disbursement
```

Reproduction with full target:

```text
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
make create-all-month-peak-500m
```

Local output proved non-transaction source rows are present after the correct full target:

```text
operational_expenses = 45
payroll_disbursements = 6
employee_debts = 13
employee_debt_payments = 6
notes = 314
customer_payments = 295
```

June handler-aligned sums:

```text
operational_expense_rupiah = 3262500
payroll_disbursement_rupiah = 7525000
employee_debt_cash_out_rupiah = 7050000
employee_debt_payments_sum_check_only = 1600000
```

Handler output:

```text
success = true
operational_expense_rupiah = 3262500
payroll_disbursement_rupiah = 7525000
employee_debt_cash_out_rupiah = 7050000
cash_operational_profit_rupiah = 418778307
```

Decision:

PR-PEAK-001 CLOSED.
Root cause was prior local DB state/run-path mismatch.
No report handler patch required.
No make dependency patch required.

Important clarification:

The operational profit handler reads employee debt cash-out from employee_debts.created_at and employee_debts.total_debt, not from employee_debt_payments.payment_date.

#### PR-PEAK-002 classification

Problem:

Peak dataset contains service-only / productless notes.

Local shape probe output:

```text
peak_note_total = 280
peak_work_item_total = 280
peak_total_rupiah = 576000000
```

Actual shape distribution:

```text
service_only_actual_productless = 80
store_stock_actual = 90
external_purchase_actual = 70
package_store_stock_actual = 40
```

Expected segment distribution:

```text
service_only_expected = 80
store_stock_expected = 90
external_purchase_expected = 70
package_store_stock_expected = 40
```

Segment-vs-actual mapping:

```text
service_only_expected -> service_only_actual_productless = 80
store_stock_expected -> store_stock_actual = 90
external_purchase_expected -> external_purchase_actual = 70
package_store_stock_expected -> package_store_stock_actual = 40
```

Line totals:

```text
notes_with_store_stock_line = 130
notes_with_external_purchase_line = 70
notes_with_no_store_stock_line = 150
notes_with_no_external_purchase_line = 210
notes_with_neither_store_stock_nor_external_purchase = 80
notes_with_both_store_stock_and_external_purchase = 0
store_stock_line_rows = 170
store_stock_qty = 260
store_stock_total_rupiah = 57875000
external_purchase_line_rows = 70
external_purchase_qty = 70
external_purchase_total_rupiah = 98000000
```

Mismatch result:

```text
mismatches = []
```

Decision:

PR-PEAK-002 CLOSED.
Productless notes are intentional service-only notes.
This is not a runtime bug.
No report handler patch required.
No create transaction runtime patch required.
No seed-shape patch required for technical correctness.

Decision:

Peak 500M operational profit report sanity and export proof are CLOSED.

#### Progress after this closure

```text
CreateOnly seed stabilization = 99%
Monthly normal 100M profile = 100%
Peak 500M profile = 100%
Full serious create-all seed system = 91-93%
```

#### Next Step

The next valid active step is to decide the next scale target:

```text
Start stress 6-8 miliar/month blueprint execution.
```

Do not start refund scaffold before the stress profile boundary is explicitly opened.

### STRESS-8B-001 - Stress 6-8B blueprint, seeder, standalone proof, and make target wiring

Local date: 2026-06-02.

Scope:

- Start stress 6-8 miliar/month execution after Peak 500M closure.
- Promote stress 8B placeholder into executable blueprint.
- Prove inventory capacity before writing seeder files.
- Patch only stress 8B seeder files.
- Prove standalone stress seeder.
- Patch `mk/seed.mk` only after standalone seeder proof.
- Do not start 10B.
- Do not start refund scaffold.
- Do not claim stress 8B full closure yet.

#### Blueprint update

Blueprint file:

```text
docs/03_blueprints/seeder/0001_create_only_seed_scale_profiles.md
```

Stress 6-8B placeholder was promoted to executable blueprint.

Target:

```text

partial_payment_notes = 576
gross_total_rupiah = 7820000000
cash_in_rupiah = 6539600000
```

Expected aggregate with seed-create-all-v3 baseline:

```text
notes = 3234
work_items = 3234
customer_payments = 2847
note_history_projection = 3234
notes_total_sum = 7848125000
customer_payments_sum = 6566250000
cash_in_rupiah = 6566250000
refunded_rupiah = 0
```

Stress item mix:

```text
service_only = 800
store_stock = 1000
external_purchase = 900
package_store_stock = 500
```

Stress payment mix:

```text
full = 2240
partial = 576
skip_unpaid = 384
```

Inventory capacity proof

Required:

```text
minimum_products = 40
required_store_stock_units = 3000
```

Local proof:

```text
product_count = 200
total_qty_on_hand = 6547
min_qty_on_hand = 13
max_qty_on_hand = 49
min_avg_cost_rupiah = 12250
max_avg_cost_rupiah = 273000
total_inventory_value_rupiah = 784994275
```

Decision:

```text
Inventory capacity PASS

work_items = 3234
customer_payments = 2847
notes_total_sum = 7848125000
customer_payments_sum = 6566250000
```

Decision:
