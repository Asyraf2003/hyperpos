# Handoff 0016 - 0044 Edit After Paid Refund Shadow UI Report Lifecycle

## Status

Active workflow handoff.

This handoff must be updated at the end of every 0044 session.

This file is not an implementation patch.

## Current Sync Note - 2026-06-25

This handoff had stale checklist entries after later lifecycle work was recorded
in `docs/04_lifecycle/handoff/0008_edit_transaction_lifecycle_characterization_handoff.md`.

Current local verification in this session:

- `make verify` PASS.
- Full Pest summary: `1416 passed, 8405 assertions`.

Automated backend/render/report proof now covers the main 0044 lifecycle areas,
including revision settlement carry-forward, refund_due/refund_paid continuity,
refund after revision current-row boundary, closed paid edit settlement preview,
payment after active revision delta, package auto split edit/revision
characterization, and report/export impact tests.

Residual gaps remain:

- real browser/manual QA;
- refresh/hard-refresh proof through an actual browser runner;
- console/visual/focus/double-click browser-only checks;
- broader audit lifecycle redesign.

Do not mark `0044` fully fixed until those residual gaps are proven or explicitly
accepted as deferred by the owner.

## Connector Rule

Do not execute direct GitHub connector write actions for this workflow.

Assistant must provide local CLI commands only unless owner explicitly overrides this rule in the same session.

Reason:

Owner controls local patching, verification, git diff, commit, and push.

## Current Objective

Build and execute the 0044 workflow slowly, one verified slice at a time:

1. Structure/source-map.
2. Edit after unpaid/paid.
3. Refund shadow/historical truth.
4. Combined edit/refund/payment/stock matrix.
5. UI backend-derived action flags.
6. Browser refresh resilience.
7. Report/PDF/Excel parity.
8. Final blast-radius verification.

## Current Slice

Slice 0 - Structure, Source Map, and Guardrail.

#### GAP

- No local test command was executed in this Slice 0 source-map update.
- No local `php artisan route:list` proof was executed yet.
- Browser refresh and hard-refresh behavior are not proven.
- Report/PDF/Excel lifecycle parity after edit/refund/surplus/refund_paid is not proven.
- Cash ledger impact is not proven in this slice.
- DB row state for a real 0044 runtime case is not inspected in this slice.

#### DECISION

- Treat `UpdateTransactionWorkspaceController` and `UpdateTransactionWorkspaceHandler` as dead/unproven path for active edit behavior until route proof says otherwise.
- Do not patch UI, report, payment, refund, inventory, projection, or allocation code in Slice 0.
- First characterization target:
  - `tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionSettlementCarryForwardFeatureTest.php`
  - first test: `test_revision_after_partial_payment_carries_paid_amount_into_underpaid_settlement`
  - second test: `test_revision_after_ordinary_refund_counts_refund_once_in_settlement`
- Next step is test-only, not runtime patch.

#### Tests / Commands Run

```bash
# ChatGPT connector read-only source inspection only.
# Local command generated to update handoff.
# No local test executed by assistant.
```

Result:

```text
Pending owner local proof after running this handoff update command.
```

Meaning:

- Slice 0 source-map is documented.
- Handoff checklist is updated.
- Production code remains untouched.

### Session Update - 2026-06-25 Local Route Proof Recorded

#### Slice

- Active slice: Slice 0 - Structure, Source Map, and Guardrail.
- Status: local route proof recorded after owner ran `php artisan route:list`.

#### Files Changed

- `docs/04_lifecycle/handoff/0016_0044_edit_after_paid_refund_shadow_ui_report_lifecycle_handoff.md`

#### FACT

- Owner ran `php artisan route:list`.
- Route output proves active admin note routes exist:
  - `admin.notes.show`
  - `admin.notes.payments.store`
  - `admin.notes.refunds.store`
  - `admin.notes.workspace.update`
  - `admin.notes.workspace.edit`

  - `cashier.notes.payments.store`
  - `cashier.notes.refunds.store`
  - `cashier.notes.workspace.update`
  - `cashier.notes.workspace.edit`

#### GAP

- No characterization test has been added yet.
- No targeted test has been run for 0044 yet.
- Browser refresh/hard-refresh behavior is still not proven.
- Report/PDF/Excel lifecycle parity is still not proven.
- Cash ledger lifecycle impact is still not proven.

#### DECISION

- Local route proof gap is now recorded.
- Slice 0 remains source-map/docs only.
- Next allowed implementation step is test-only:
  - create `tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionSettlementCarryForwardFeatureTest.php`
  - start with `test_revision_after_partial_payment_carries_paid_amount_into_underpaid_settlement`
- Production code patch remains forbidden until RED proof exists.

#### Tests / Commands Run

```bash
php artisan route:list
```

Result:

```text
Owner output showed 172 routes and included active admin/cashier note edit, payment, refund, surplus refund due/refund paid, transaction report, PDF export, Excel export, and cash ledger routes.
```

Meaning:

- Active route map from Slice 0 is locally verified.
- `UpdateTransactionWorkspaceController` / `UpdateTransactionWorkspaceHandler` remain dead/unproven as active edit route path unless future route proof says otherwise.

#### Checklist Changes

- No new checklist checkbox added.
- Existing Slice 0 route-map checkboxes remain valid with local proof attached.

#### Residual Gaps

- First characterization test still pending.
- Test fixture proof still pending.
- Runtime DB proof still pending.
- Browser refresh proof still pending.
- Report/export parity proof still pending.

#### Next Allowed Step

- Test-only characterization for revision carry-forward settlement.


### Session Update - 2026-06-25 Current Proof Sync

#### FACT

- Error log `0041` is already recorded as selesai and verified.
- Error log `0042` is already recorded as selesai and verified.
- Error log `0043` had stale top status, but later sections and current full suite prove the allocator guard is fixed.
- Error log `0044` had stale "belum patch" status, but later lifecycle work proves automated backend/render/report coverage.
- Current `make verify` passes.
- Current full Pest summary is `1416 passed, 8405 assertions`.
- The full suite includes 0043 service package component refund pay-again matrix coverage.
- The full suite includes 0044 edit/revision/refund/package/report coverage such as:
  - `NoteRevisionSettlementCarryForwardFeatureTest`
  - `NoteRevisionRefundDueCarryForwardFeatureTest`
  - `CreateNoteRevisionSurplusRefundPaidCarryForwardFeatureTest`
  - `RefundAfterRevisionCurrentRowBoundaryFeatureTest`
  - `TransactionCashLedgerAfterRevisionRefundFeatureTest`
  - `ClosedPaidNoteEditPaymentSettlementPreviewFeatureTest`
  - `PaymentAfterRevisionSettlementFeatureTest`
  - `EditTransactionWorkspacePackageAutoSplitCharacterizationTest`
  - `PackageAutoSplitRevisionReportImpactFeatureTest`

#### GAP

- Real browser/manual QA is not closed.
- Browser refresh/hard-refresh behavior is not proven through a real browser runner.
- Console errors, responsive visual behavior, modal focus, and real double-click timing remain browser/manual-only checks unless a browser runner is introduced.
- Broader audit lifecycle redesign remains transitional.
- No git operation was performed.

#### DECISION

- Treat 0043 as fixed with proof.
- Treat 0044 as patched with automated proof, not fully fixed, until remaining browser/manual/audit gaps are proven or explicitly deferred by owner decision.
- Do not patch report code to hide lifecycle state.
- Do not start broader audit redesign under this issue without a new active scope.

Pest: 1416 passed (8405 assertions)
Duration: 96.80s
```

Meaning:

- Current repo baseline is GREEN after 0041-0044 lifecycle work.
- Automated proof supports the status sync.
- Remaining 0044 closure risk is browser/manual/audit scope, not current automated regression failure.

#### Checklist Changes

- 0043 status synchronized to fixed with proof.
- 0044 status synchronized to patched with automated proof and residual manual/audit gaps.
- Active handoff updated so future sessions do not restart from stale Slice 0 pending-test state.

#### Residual Gaps

- Browser/manual QA.
- Real refresh/hard-refresh proof.
- Browser-only console/visual/focus/double-click checks.
- Broader audit lifecycle redesign.

#### Next Allowed Step

- Owner decision: either defer the remaining browser/manual/audit gaps explicitly, or open a browser-runner/manual-QA slice for 0044 refresh and UI behavior proof.

### Session Update - 2026-07-01 09:08 WITA - 2026-07-01 Refund Shadow Edit Workspace Test Contract Alignment

#### Slice

- Active slice: 0044 residual/test-contract alignment.
- Status: automated proof PASS after test expectation was aligned with refund shadow policy.
- Production runtime patch: none.

#### Files Read

- `docs/02_architecture/adr/0042_note_edit_refund_settlement_machine_contract.md`
- `docs/04_lifecycle/error_log/0062_transaction_edit_refund_payment_stock_reporting_hardening_campaign.md`

#### Files Changed

- `docs/04_lifecycle/handoff/0016_0044_edit_after_paid_refund_shadow_ui_report_lifecycle_handoff.md`

#### FACT

- Owner clarified the active edit workspace policy:
  - any line with refund allocation becomes refund shadow in the edit workspace;
  - refund shadow lines must not be shown as editable old draft rows;
  - edit workspace old draft rows are built only from non-refunded editable current lines.
- The failing test case inserted a refund allocation for `wi-old-1`, then still expected the edit page to contain `revision_snapshot`.
- That old expectation was stale because `revision_snapshot` on the edit page means the refunded old line was preloaded as an editable old item.
- The local edit page now correctly asserts:
  - `"oldItems":[]`;
  - `revision_snapshot` is not present for the refunded-shadow line.
- The existing non-refunded price-snapshot test still keeps `revision_snapshot` coverage for normal editable old lines.

#### GAP

- No runtime gap was proven in this session.
- The previous failure was a stale test-contract expectation, not a reason to reopen refunded lines in `EditTransactionWorkspaceEditableLineFilter`.
- Do not change the filter to allow refunded lines back into old editable draft rows.
- If a future implementation wants active remainder splitting, it must be introduced by a separate ADR/test contract and must not silently reopen refund shadow anchors.

#### DECISION

- Align `test_cashier_product_replacement_reuses_only_net_payment_after_refund` with ADR-0042 refund shadow behavior.
- Keep refunded lines out of edit workspace `oldItems`.
- Treat the changed assertion as policy alignment, not test weakening.
- Do not reopen 0062 runtime campaign; 0062 remains closed by automated proof with no remaining backlog for that campaign.
- 0044 residual browser/manual/audit gaps remain unchanged.

#### Tests / Commands Run

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/CashierProductReplacementBackdatedPriceFinanceFeatureTest.php \
  --filter=test_cashier_product_replacement_reuses_only_net_payment_after_refund

make verify
```

Result:

```text
PASS  Tests\Feature\Note\CashierProductReplacementBackdatedPriceFinanceFeatureTest
Tests: 1 passed (10 assertions)

Tests: 1476 passed (9191 assertions)
Duration: 94.93s
```

Meaning:

- The targeted refund-shadow edit workspace regression is green.
- The full automated suite is green after the test-contract alignment.
- No production runtime behavior was changed to satisfy the test.

#### Checklist Changes

- [x] Refund-shadow edit workspace test expectation aligned with owner policy and ADR-0042.
- [x] Full automated verification recorded.
- [x] Runtime filter was intentionally not loosened.

#### Residual Gaps

- Real browser/manual QA remains outside this patch.
- Refresh/hard-refresh proof remains outside this patch.
- Console/visual/focus/real double-click checks remain outside this patch.
- Broader audit lifecycle redesign remains outside this patch unless owner opens a new scope.

#### Next Allowed Step

- If continuing 0044 closure, either:
  - record owner deferral/acceptance for remaining browser/manual QA gaps; or
  - introduce a real browser runner/manual QA proof for refresh, hard-refresh, modal focus, visual, console, and double-click behavior.
- Future Codex/AI sessions must not re-add `revision_snapshot` visibility for refunded-shadow old lines as a shortcut.

### Session Update - 2026-07-01 12:09 WITA - Refund Shadow Identity Allocation Hardening

#### Slice

- Active slice: 0044 residual/test-contract hardening.
- Status: automated proof PASS after adding identity/allocation assertions.
- Production runtime patch: none.

#### Files Changed

- `docs/04_lifecycle/handoff/0016_0044_edit_after_paid_refund_shadow_ui_report_lifecycle_handoff.md`

#### FACT

- ADR-0042 says refunded lines are refund shadow, not editable draft lines.
- The edit workspace must keep refunded-shadow old lines out of `oldItems`.
- `revision_snapshot` visibility remains valid only for old editable/non-refunded lines.
- `EditTransactionWorkspaceEditableLineFilter` must not be loosened to re-show refunded lines.
- The stale-payload test now also locks that:
  - refund history remains anchored to `wi-old-1`;
  - the revision creates one new current work item;
  - old refunded-shadow work item receives zero active payment allocation after replacement;
  - the new current replacement line receives only the net available payment after refund.

#### GAP

- No runtime bug was proven by the added assertions.
- Real browser/manual QA remains outside this automated proof.
- Browser refresh/hard-refresh, console, visual, focus, and real double-click checks remain residual.
- Broader audit lifecycle redesign remains outside this patch.

#### DECISION

- Treat the stale `revision_snapshot` payload as a current replacement payload when accepted by backend rules.
- Do not revive old refunded-shadow identity.
- Do not allocate active current payment back to the old refunded-shadow work item.
- Keep this as test-only hardening; no runtime patch was needed.

#### Tests / Commands Run

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/CashierProductReplacementBackdatedPriceFinanceFeatureTest.php \
  --filter=test_cashier_product_replacement_reuses_only_net_payment_after_refund

make verify
```

Result:

```text
PASS  Tests\Feature\Note\CashierProductReplacementBackdatedPriceFinanceFeatureTest
Tests: 1 passed (17 assertions)

Tests: 1476 passed (9198 assertions)
Duration: 99.57s
```

Meaning:

- Refund-shadow edit workspace behavior is still green.
- The stale payload cannot silently reallocate active current payment to the old refunded-shadow identity.
- Full automated verification remains green after the hardening assertions.

#### Checklist Changes

- [x] Refunded-shadow old line stays out of editable `oldItems`.
- [x] `revision_snapshot` is absent for refunded-shadow old line and still covered for normal editable old lines.
- [x] Stale payload identity/allocation behavior has explicit regression assertions.
- [x] Full automated verification recorded.

#### Residual Gaps

- Real browser/manual QA remains open.
- Refresh/hard-refresh proof remains open.
- Browser-only console/visual/focus/double-click checks remain open.
- Broader audit lifecycle redesign remains open unless owner starts that scope.

#### Next Allowed Step

- Continue only with a browser-runner/manual QA slice or explicit owner deferral for the remaining 0044 residual gaps.

### Session Update - 2026-07-01 17:52 WITA - Golden Lifecycle Automated QA Extension

#### Slice

- Active slice: 0044 automated-first residual QA.
- Status: targeted edit/refund/payment/stock/reporting proof PASS.
- Production runtime patch: none.

#### Files Read

- `docs/04_lifecycle/handoff/0016_0044_edit_after_paid_refund_shadow_ui_report_lifecycle_handoff.md`

#### FACT

- The existing normal editable line test still proves non-refunded old lines
  preload `revision_snapshot`.
- The refunded-shadow flow still proves edit workspace renders
  `"oldItems":[]` and does not render `revision_snapshot` for the old
  refunded-shadow line.
- The stale `revision_snapshot` payload is accepted only as a replacement
  flow and does not revive the old refunded work item identity.
- The old refunded work item remains the refund history anchor.
- The current replacement receives a new work item identity.
- Active payment allocation is not reassigned to the old refunded-shadow
  work item.

#### GAP

- No new runtime bug was proven.
- No production code was changed.
- Browser refresh/hard-refresh, console, visual, focus, and real
  double-click checks remain outside this automated proof.
- Broader audit lifecycle redesign remains outside this patch.

#### DECISION

- Extend the existing golden refund-shadow lifecycle test rather than
  creating a parallel fixture file.
- Lock the financial split between current allocation and physical cash
  ledger:
  - current replacement gets net available allocation after refund;
  - customer payment and refund cash rows remain preserved;
  - cash ledger reports total in/out from money events.
- Lock stock/reporting guardrails:
  - old issued stock is revision-reversed exactly once;
  - no extra refund reversal is created by edit;
  - replacement line issues stock exactly once;
  - transaction, cash ledger, inventory movement, and operational profit
    handlers reconcile the same lifecycle.

#### Tests / Commands Run

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Note/CashierProductReplacementBackdatedPriceFinanceFeatureTest.php \

SUCCESS: Semua file memenuhi standar limit baris (atau memiliki label bypass).
```

Meaning:

- Golden lifecycle automated QA now covers edit workspace shadow behavior,
  stale payload identity, allocation preservation, stock reversal/reissue,
  cash ledger, transaction summary, inventory movement, and operational
  profit reconciliation.
- The added proof is test-only hardening.
- Full automated verification and line audit remain green.
- 0044 is still not a real-browser/manual closure.

#### Checklist Changes

- [x] Golden lifecycle automated QA extended.
- [x] Refunded-shadow old line stays out of editable `oldItems`.
- [x] `revision_snapshot` remains absent for refunded-shadow old line.
- [x] Normal editable old line keeps `revision_snapshot` coverage.
- [x] Stale payload does not revive old refunded identity.
- [x] Old refund anchor remains historical.
- [x] Current replacement uses a new identity.
- [x] Payment/refund/allocation/stock/report assertions added.

#### Residual Gaps

- Real browser/manual QA remains open/deferred.
- Refresh/hard-refresh proof remains open/deferred.
- Browser-only console/visual/focus/double-click checks remain open/deferred.
- Broader audit lifecycle redesign remains open unless owner starts that scope.

#### Next Allowed Step

- Stop with automated-first residual documented, or start a separate
  browser/manual QA slice if owner opens that scope.
