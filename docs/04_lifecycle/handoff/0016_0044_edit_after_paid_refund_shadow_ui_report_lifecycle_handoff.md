# Handoff 0016 - 0044 Edit After Paid Refund Shadow UI Report Lifecycle

## Status

Active workflow handoff.

This handoff must be updated at the end of every 0044 session.

This file is not an implementation patch.

## Connector Rule

Do not execute direct GitHub connector write actions for this workflow.

Assistant must provide local CLI commands only unless owner explicitly overrides this rule in the same session.

Reason:

Owner controls local patching, verification, git diff, commit, and push.

## Current Objective

Build and execute the 0044 workflow slowly, one verified slice at a time:

1. Structure/source-map.
2. Edit after unpaid/paid.
3. Refund shadow/historical truth.
4. Combined edit/refund/payment/stock matrix.
5. UI backend-derived action flags.
6. Browser refresh resilience.
7. Report/PDF/Excel parity.
8. Final blast-radius verification.

## Current Slice

Slice 0 - Structure, Source Map, and Guardrail.

#### GAP

- No local test command was executed in this Slice 0 source-map update.
- No local `php artisan route:list` proof was executed yet.
- Browser refresh and hard-refresh behavior are not proven.
- Report/PDF/Excel lifecycle parity after edit/refund/surplus/refund_paid is not proven.
- Cash ledger impact is not proven in this slice.
- DB row state for a real 0044 runtime case is not inspected in this slice.

#### DECISION

- Treat `UpdateTransactionWorkspaceController` and `UpdateTransactionWorkspaceHandler` as dead/unproven path for active edit behavior until route proof says otherwise.
- Do not patch UI, report, payment, refund, inventory, projection, or allocation code in Slice 0.
- First characterization target:
  - `tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionSettlementCarryForwardFeatureTest.php`
  - first test: `test_revision_after_partial_payment_carries_paid_amount_into_underpaid_settlement`
  - second test: `test_revision_after_ordinary_refund_counts_refund_once_in_settlement`
- Next step is test-only, not runtime patch.

#### Tests / Commands Run

```bash
# ChatGPT connector read-only source inspection only.
# Local command generated to update handoff.
# No local test executed by assistant.
```

Result:

```text
Pending owner local proof after running this handoff update command.
```

Meaning:

- Slice 0 source-map is documented.
- Handoff checklist is updated.
- Production code remains untouched.

#### Checklist Changes

- [x] Active edit routes mapped.
- [x] Active refund routes mapped.
- [x] Active payment routes mapped.
- [x] Note detail UI data source mapped.
- [x] UI action flag builders mapped.
- [x] Note revision services mapped.
- [x] Payment allocation services mapped.
- [x] Refund allocation services mapped.
- [x] Inventory movement services mapped.
- [x] Note history projection mapped.
- [x] Surplus/refund_due/refund_paid records mapped.

#### Residual Gaps

- Local route proof remains required.
- Local test fixture proof remains required.
- Browser refresh/hard-refresh proof remains required.
- Report/PDF/Excel parity proof remains required.
- Cash ledger impact proof remains required.
- Runtime DB proof for a concrete 0044 lifecycle case remains required.

#### Next Allowed Step

- Add only `tests/Feature/Note/NoteRevisionSettlementCarryForwardFeatureTest.php`.
- Run only targeted characterization test first.
- Stop on first failure and record RED proof before any production patch.
