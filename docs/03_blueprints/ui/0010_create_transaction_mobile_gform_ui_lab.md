# 0010 - Create Transaction Mobile Google Form UI Lab Blueprint

## Metadata

- Date: 2026-06-03
- Slice / topic: Create transaction mobile UI experiment
- Workflow step: Blueprint
- Status: Proposed, not implemented
- Progress: Blueprint only

## Target

Create a dedicated UI lab for the create transaction workspace with 10 mobile-first variants inspired by Google Form simplicity.

The goal is to compare several mobile UI approaches before changing the production create transaction page.

## Current State

The current create transaction workspace uses:

- `resources/views/cashier/notes/workspace/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/cashier/notes/workspace/partials/rincian-card.blade.php`
- `resources/views/cashier/notes/workspace/partials/info-card.blade.php`
- `resources/views/cashier/notes/workspace/partials/payment-modal.blade.php`
- dynamic Blade templates for transaction item types
- existing workspace JavaScript for row handling, product search, summary, payment flow, draft restore, and bootstrapping

The production create page currently mixes desktop-oriented layout with mobile usage needs.

## Problem

The create transaction UI is used on mobile, but the current layout still behaves like a PC-first workspace.

The UI must become simpler and more mobile-friendly without losing the existing transaction contract.

## Binding Rules

- Do not patch production `create.blade.php` before the UI lab is reviewed.
- Do not change backend store logic.
- Do not change validation rules.
- Do not change database schema.
- Do not treat create UI proof as edit, refund, or revision proof.
- Preserve the create transaction payload contract.
- Preserve traceability between UI fields and backend request fields.
- Implementation must remain step-by-step.

## Contract To Preserve

### Form

- Form id:
  - `cashier-note-workspace-form`
- Create action:
  - `route('notes.workspace.store')`
- Method:
  - `POST`

### Note Fields

- `note[customer_name]`
- `note[customer_phone]`
- `note[transaction_date]`
- `note[operational_note]`

### Item Fields

- `items[n][entry_mode]`
- `items[n][description]`
- `items[n][part_source]`
- `items[n][pricing_mode]`
- `items[n][package_total_rupiah]`
- `items[n][service][name]`
- `items[n][service][price_rupiah]`
- `items[n][service][notes]`
- `items[n][product_lines][m][product_id]`
- `items[n][product_lines][m][qty]`
- `items[n][product_lines][m][unit_price_rupiah]`
- `items[n][external_purchase_lines][0][label]`
- `items[n][external_purchase_lines][0][qty]`
- `items[n][external_purchase_lines][0][unit_cost_rupiah]`

### Inline Payment Fields

- `inline_payment[decision]`
- `inline_payment[payment_method]`
- `inline_payment[paid_at]`
- `inline_payment[amount_paid_rupiah]`
- `inline_payment[amount_received_rupiah]`
- `inline_payment[notes]`

### Important UI/Data Hooks

The UI lab must preserve or intentionally map these hooks if it reuses existing JavaScript:

- `cashier-note-workspace-form`
- `cashier-note-workspace-config`
- `workspace-line-items`
- `workspace-empty-state`
- `workspace-add-button`
- `workspace-item-type-menu`
- `workspace-open-payment-dialog`
- `data-line-item`
- `data-item-type`
- `data-line-title`
- `data-remove-line`
- `data-product-line`
- `data-product-lines`
- `data-product-line-template`
- `data-add-product-line`
- `data-remove-product-line`
- `data-product-search`
- `data-product-results`
- `data-product-id`
- `data-price-input`
- `data-price-basis`
- `data-qty-input`
- `data-money-raw`
- `data-money-display`
- `data-package-total-input`
- `data-pricing-mode`

## Scope In

- Create a UI lab page for create transaction mobile experiments.
- Build 10 mobile-first layout variants.
- Keep variants as Blade-based prototypes.
- Preserve realistic form field names and submit contract.
- Add only routing/controller/view files required to access the lab.
- Use the UI lab to compare concepts before production adoption.

## Scope Out

- Production create page replacement.
- Backend handler changes.
- Store request validation changes.
- Database changes.
- Edit transaction lifecycle.
- Refund lifecycle.
- Revision lifecycle.
- Report/export changes.
- Product lookup backend changes.
- Payment settlement backend changes.

## Recommended File Plan

- `resources/views/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/partials/variant-10.blade.php`

## UI Variants

### Variant 01 - Google Form Single Scroll

One long mobile-first form.

Purpose:

- Establish the simplest baseline.
- Reduce page complexity.
- Make the full transaction flow readable from top to bottom.

### Variant 02 - Google Form Step Cards

Create visual step cards:

1. Info Nota
2. Rincian
3. Pembayaran

Purpose:

- Make workflow sequence clearer.
- Avoid overwhelming the cashier with all fields at once.

### Variant 03 - Compact Cashier Fast Entry

Fast entry mode with:

- fewer helper texts
- larger primary fields
- large action buttons
- minimal decoration

Purpose:

- Optimize for repeated cashier usage.

### Variant 04 - Sticky Total Bottom Bar

Use bottom sticky bar containing:

- current total
- primary process button
- optional quick save action

Purpose:

- Keep the main action reachable on mobile.

### Variant 05 - Accordion Sections

Use collapsible sections:

- Informasi Nota
- Rincian Nota
- Pembayaran

Purpose:

- Reduce scroll fatigue.
- Keep context grouped.

### Variant 06 - Service Store Stock First

Prioritize service + store-stock package flow:

- service name
- package total
- sparepart search
- qty
- add sparepart

Purpose:

- Optimize the most complex create flow before generalizing.

### Variant 07 - Card Per Item

Every transaction line becomes a dedicated mobile card.

Purpose:

- Improve readability for multiple item entries.
- Make remove/edit actions local to each item.

### Variant 08 - Review Before Payment

Show a review page/sheet before payment action.

Purpose:

- Reduce accidental submit.
- Give clear summary before choosing skip/full/partial payment.

### Variant 09 - One Hand Mode

Design around thumb reach:

- main actions near bottom
- full-width fields
- minimal horizontal controls
- large touch targets

Purpose:

- Improve mobile ergonomics during real cashier usage.

### Variant 10 - Dense Mobile Power User

Keep mobile layout but make it denser.

Purpose:

- Serve experienced users who need speed, not hand-holding.

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Step 1 - UI Lab Shell

Create:

- controller
- route
- main lab view
- styles partial
- variant tabs partial
- one initial variant

Proof target:

- route exists
- page renders
- no production create page changed

### Step 2 - Add 10 Static Variants

Create all 10 variant partials.

Proof target:

- all partials are included and renderable
- no backend behavior changed

### Step 3 - Add Variant Switcher

Add simple query/tab switcher.

Proof target:

- each variant can be opened directly
- UI state is readable on mobile width

### Step 4 - Contract Audit

Check that prototype keeps required field names and action contract.

Proof target:

- grep confirms required names exist
- route/list confirms UI lab route exists

### Step 5 - Manual Mobile Review

Open in mobile width and choose one or two candidates.

Proof target:

- manual screenshots or user confirmation
- chosen variant documented before production patch

### Step 6 - Production Adoption Blueprint

Only after selection, write a production adoption blueprint.

Proof target:

- selected variant is explicitly chosen
- affected production files listed
- rollback path listed

## Verification Commands

Run from repo root after implementation:

```bash
php artisan route:list --name=mobile-ui-lab
php artisan view:clear
rg -n "mobile-ui-lab|CreateTransactionWorkspaceMobileUiLabPageController" routes app resources/views
rg -n "note\\[customer_name\\]|items\\[|inline_payment\\[decision\\]" resources/views/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab*
```

If implementation touches PHP or Blade enough to require full verification:

```bash
make verify
```

## Risks

- Reusing existing workspace JavaScript may require preserving many IDs and data attributes.
- Building fully independent prototype JavaScript may create duplicate behavior.
- Production replacement before review can break existing create flow.
- Payment modal behavior may need mobile-specific treatment, but backend contract must remain unchanged.
- Service + store-stock package auto split is the highest-risk UI path because it combines package total, product lookup, qty, and auto split semantics.

## Decision

Start with a separate UI lab.

Do not replace the production create transaction page until one variant is selected and documented.

## Next Active Step

Patch UI lab shell only:

- add controller
- add route
- add main lab view
- add style partial
- add variant tabs partial
- add variant 01 only as first render proof

Do not add all 10 full variants in the same active step.

---

## ADDENDUM - UI-Only Preview Scope Correction

### FACT

The UI lab is not a backend contract implementation.

The UI lab is only a mobile web interface exploration.

The source create transaction page is used only to extract:

- visible form sections
- form content meaning
- cashier workflow order
- UI pain points
- core labels and concepts

### DECISION

Do not bind UI variants to Laravel request fields, backend submit actions, workspace JavaScript hooks, validation rules, or transaction handlers during the UI exploration phase.

A route/controller may exist only as a preview entry point.

The UI itself should be treated as independent HTML/CSS Blade markup.

### SCOPE-IN

- Blade UI preview
- mobile-first layout
- static HTML form mockup
- optional small JavaScript only for visual interaction
- 10 UI variants created one by one

### SCOPE-OUT

- backend submit
- request payload contract
- existing workspace JavaScript integration
- product lookup integration
- payment handler integration
- create transaction production replacement
- edit/refund/revision flows

### Preview Rule

The preview page must not link back into the production create transaction workflow unless explicitly needed for comparison.

### Next Active Step

Continue with Variant 01 as a pure mobile UI preview.

After Variant 01 is reviewed, continue to Variant 02.

Do not create all 10 variants at once.

---

## ADDENDUM - Variant 02 UI Preview

### FACT

Variant 01 exists as a pure mobile single-scroll UI preview.

### DECISION

Variant 02 will explore a step-card layout.

The UI remains independent from backend submit, Laravel request names, workspace JavaScript hooks, and product lookup behavior.

### Variant 02 Goal

Use large mobile cards to split the create transaction flow into:

1. Informasi Nota
2. Rincian Nota
3. Pembayaran

This variant tests whether the create transaction page feels clearer when grouped into visible workflow steps instead of one continuous form.

### Scope

- Add `variant-02.blade.php`
- Add small step-card CSS partial
- Include Variant 02 in the preview page after Variant 01

### Scope Out

- backend integration
- route changes
- controller changes
- production create page changes

### Next Active Step

Review Variant 02 in mobile preview, then continue to Variant 03 only after feedback.

---

## ADDENDUM - Variant 03 UI Preview

### FACT

Variant 01 exists as a pure mobile single-scroll UI preview.
Variant 02 exists as a pure mobile step-card UI preview.

### DECISION

Variant 03 will explore compact cashier fast entry.

The UI remains independent from backend submit, Laravel request names, workspace JavaScript hooks, and product lookup behavior.

### Variant 03 Goal

Test whether create transaction can feel faster for repeated cashier use by reducing helper text and emphasizing:

- quick customer input
- quick transaction type selection
- compact active item entry
- visible total
- large primary action

### Scope

- Add `variant-03.blade.php`
- Add compact cashier CSS partial
- Include Variant 03 in the preview page after Variant 02

### Scope Out

- backend integration
- route changes
- controller changes
- production create page changes

### Next Active Step

Review Variant 03 in mobile preview, then continue to Variant 04 only after feedback.

## ADDENDUM - Pure Google Form Visual Direction

### FACT

The first UI preview still used the app layout shell, which means it inherited the application/Mazer visual frame.

### DECISION

The mobile UI lab must render as a standalone preview page.

Do not extend `layouts.app` for the preview page.

The preview route may remain as the access door, but the view must behave like an independent mobile web mockup.

### Visual Direction

The UI should resemble Google Forms:

- soft purple page background
- centered form column
- white form cards
- purple top accent
- simple title and description
- clean input underline style
- radio-like option rows
- large but minimal mobile spacing
- no admin dashboard chrome
- no Mazer card styling

### Scope

- Rewrite the preview shell as standalone HTML.
- Rewrite Variant 01 as a Google Form-like mobile UI.
- Keep backend integration out of scope.

### Next Active Step

Review Variant 01 as a pure Google Form-like preview before continuing to other variants.

- Keep backend integration out of scope.

### Next Active Step

Review Variant 01 as a pure Google Form-like preview before continuing to other variants.

## ADDENDUM - Google Form UI Variants 02-10 Preview Batch

### FACT

Variant 01 has been corrected into a standalone Google Form-like visual preview.

### DECISION

Variants 02 through 10 will be implemented as UI-only Blade partials in the same standalone preview page.

These variants are not backend forms.

They do not use Laravel request field names, workspace JavaScript hooks, product lookup, payment handlers, or production create transaction layout.

### Variants Added

- Variant 02: Step Cards
- Variant 03: Fast Entry
- Variant 04: Sticky Total Bottom Bar
- Variant 05: Accordion Sections
- Variant 06: Service Store Stock First
- Variant 07: Card Per Item
- Variant 08: Review Before Payment
- Variant 09: One Hand Mode
- Variant 10: Dense Mobile Power User

### Review Rule

The preview page may show all variants in one scrollable page with local anchor navigation.

After visual review, choose one candidate before any production create page replacement is planned.

---

## ADDENDUM - Separate Interactive Dummy Pages Correction

### FACT

The previous 10 variants were too visually similar because they shared the same Google Form card pattern.

### DECISION

The UI lab must become 10 separate interactive dummy preview pages.

Each variant should be reachable through its own route path:

- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/01`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/02`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/03`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/04`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/05`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/06`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/07`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/08`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/09`
- `/cashier/notes/workspace/mobile-ui-lab/10`

The variants are still UI-only and must not bind to backend submit, request fields, product lookup, payment handlers, or existing workspace JavaScript.

### Required Behavior

The dummy UI may use local fake JavaScript for:

- choosing products
- adding cart items
- removing cart items
- changing visual steps
- showing fake payment selection
- opening bottom sheet or drawer
- keypad-style price input
- live receipt preview
- static dummy totals

### Variant Directions

- 01: Google Form Classic Product Picker
- 02: Stepper Wizard
- 03: POS Keypad
- 04: Bottom Sheet Checkout
- 05: Accordion Checklist
- 06: Service Package Builder
- 07: Chat Style Intake
- 08: Live Receipt Split View
- 09: One-Hand Thumb UI
- 10: Dense Table Power User

### Review Rule

Client review should compare the 10 separate pages and select the most comfortable direction before any production create page replacement is planned.
