# Audit Write Path Matrix

## Status

Readiness matrix plus proven outbox pilot/global-binding progress notes.

This document is not a replacement for local command proof.

Audit outbox implementation and global binding switch were authorized and proven later by operator output and handoff.

Transaction-heavy flows remain excluded from this slice.

## Source Snapshot

Local proof provided by owner:

- repo root: `/home/asyraf/Code/laravel/bengkel2/app`
- branch: `main...origin/main`
- HEAD: `1b62d18a`

## Purpose

Map the current HyperPOS audit write paths while migrating audit runtime behavior in controlled slices.

The immediate goal is to prevent unsafe expansion from the proven expense category outbox slice into legacy audit or transaction-heavy flows without source and test proof.

## Binding Facts

Current binding from latest active handoff and operator proof:

- `AuditEventWriterPort` is bound globally to `DatabaseAuditOutboxWriterAdapter`.
- `DatabaseAuditEventWriterAdapter` remains the concrete canonical materializer used by the outbox processor and direct adapter test.
- `AuditLogPort` remains bound to `DatabaseAuditLogAdapter`.

Current runtime implication for proven canonical expense category flows:

- canonical audit writes are staged to `audit_outbox`;
- `audit_events` and `audit_event_snapshots` remain empty before processor execution;
- `audit:outbox:process` materializes canonical audit records;
- processed outbox rows are marked `processed`;
- legacy `audit_logs` remains untouched for these canonical expense category tests.

## Canonical Audit Path

| Area | File | Event / factory | Current behavior | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Note | `app/Application/Note/UseCases/CreateNoteRevisionSurplusRefundDueHandler.php` | `CreateNoteRevisionSurplusRefundDueAuditEventFactory` | Calls `AuditEventWriterPort::write()` inside transaction before disposition writer create and commit | canonical | Existing canonical audit path. Finance-sensitive. Not a first broad outbox switch target without focused proof. |
| Note | `app/Application/Note/UseCases/RecordNoteRevisionSurplusRefundPaymentHandler.php` | `RecordNoteRevisionSurplusRefundPaymentAuditEventFactory` | Calls `AuditEventWriterPort::write()` inside transaction before payment writer create and commit | canonical | Existing canonical audit path with idempotency check. Finance-sensitive. Requires focused proof before any binding change. |
| Test | `tests/Feature/AuditLog/DatabaseAuditEventWriterAdapterTest.php` | `new AuditEventWrite(...)` | Tests canonical adapter | canonical_test | Adapter test only. Not a mutation flow. |

## Non-Audit Or Needs-Separation Calls

These calls appeared in broad `record()` / `write()` grep but must not be classified as audit without source proof:

| Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `timeline->record(...)` | Timeline write, not `AuditLogPort` by itself |
| `reversals->record(...)` | Business reversal writer, not audit by itself |
| `reversalWriter->record(...)` | Business reversal writer, not audit by itself |
| `adjustmentWriter->record(...)` | Business adjustment writer, not audit by itself |
| `payments->record(...)` | Payment recorder, not audit by itself |
| Reporting Excel workbook `->write(...)` calls | Export writer calls, not `AuditEventWriterPort` |

## First-Pilot Candidate Notes

Do not pick a transaction-heavy first pilot.

Explicitly excluded for first outbox pilot:

- customer payment allocation
- customer refund
- selected-row refund
- transaction workspace create/update
- paid correction
- note revision commit
- inventory stock mutation/reversal
- supplier receipt/payment/reversal
- employee finance payment/reversal/payroll
- projection rebuilds

Possible later pilot candidates after source and test proof:

- expense category update / activate / deactivate
- identity access capability enable / disable
- identity access capability used audit

Expense category update / activate / deactivate are no longer only candidates for this slice.

They are the proven canonical audit outbox pilot group for the current selected regression scope.

Identity access remains only a possible later candidate.

## Required Proof Before Further Outbox Expansion

Before expanding beyond the proven expense category slice, provide:

1. owner approval of the next flow;
2. source inspection for the selected flow;
3. red/green or characterization test for existing audit behavior;
4. proof of current audit payload shape;
5. proof that the flow is not payment/refund/allocation/stock/transaction-heavy;
6. focused outbox staging proof;
7. processor canonical materialization proof;
8. retry/failure behavior proof when relevant;
9. duplicate processor run proof when relevant;
10. proof that canonical `audit_events` and `audit_event_snapshots` are materialized correctly.

## Stop Conditions

Stop before implementation if:

- selected pilot touches payment/refund/allocation/transaction workspace;
- selected pilot touches stock mutation/reversal;
- selected pilot touches payroll/debt/payment finance flows;
- selected pilot requires public contract change;
- selected pilot has no characterization test path;
- source inspection shows audit payload lacks actor/reason/source facts needed for canonical audit;
- owner decision is missing.

## Next Active Step

Do not expand runtime audit coverage from this matrix without a new explicit active step.

Safe next candidates are separate decisions:

- docs/handoff closure for the proven Phase 4 selected regression;
- minimal pending/failed audit outbox monitoring;
- unrelated `make verify` seeder PHPStan remediation.

Payment/refund/allocation/stock/transaction-heavy flows remain excluded.
