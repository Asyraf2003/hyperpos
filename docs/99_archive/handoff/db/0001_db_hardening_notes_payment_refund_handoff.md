# Handoff 0001 - DB Hardening Notes, Payment, and Refund

Status: Active handoff  
Scope: DB hardening from `notes` timestamp focused verification into `customer_payments` / `customer_refunds` audit  
Owner: HyperPOS  

## 1. Final Goal

Selesaikan masalah DB hardening di `docs/03_blueprints/db/` satu per satu dengan urutan:

1. matrix,
2. source audit,
3. narrow patch blueprint,
4. RED or characterization proof,
5. minimal patch,
6. targeted proof,
7. focused proof,
8. docs alignment.

Workflow tetap mengikuti:

- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0001_temporal_audit_columns_blueprint.md`
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0002_mysql_postgresql_crud_readiness_blueprint.md`
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0003_db_hardening_workflow.md`
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0004_db_audit_matrix.md`
- `docs/02_architecture/adr/0028_mysql_to_postgresql_and_api_migration_readiness.md`

## 2. Current Scope

Current completed group:

- `notes`

Current active next group:

- `customer_payments`
- `customer_refunds`
- related child/detail/linkage:
  - `customer_payment_cash_details`
  - `payment_allocations`
  - `payment_component_allocations`
  - `refund_component_allocations`
  - report/read paths using payment/refund dates

## 3. Completed Notes Slice

`notes` timestamp hardening reached Focused Verified.

Production files changed:

- `database/migrations/2026_05_15_000100_add_system_timestamps_to_notes_table.php`
- `app/Adapters/Out/Note/DatabaseNoteWriterAdapter.php`

Test files changed:

- `tests/Feature/Database/V2NoteOperationalStateMigrationTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Note/NoteOperationalStatePersistenceFeatureTest.php`

Docs changed:

- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0004_db_audit_matrix.md`
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0005_notes_timestamp_patch_blueprint.md`

Proof:

- RED targeted schema test failed with `Missing notes.created_at`: 1 failed, 2 passed, 20 assertions.
- GREEN targeted schema test passed: 3 tests, 21 assertions.
- GREEN writer persistence test passed: 2 tests, 16 assertions.
- Focused create flow test passed: 3 tests, 10 assertions.
- Focused blast-radius suite passed: 31 tests, 186 assertions.
- Final `git diff --check` was clean.
- Final anchors showed migration/writer/test timestamp content still present.

Notes timestamp decisions:

- `transaction_date` remains business/report date.
- `due_date` remains due date.
- `closed_at` / `reopened_at` remain lifecycle action timestamps.
- `created_at` means system row persistence time.
- `updated_at` means system row mutation time.
- Historical `created_at` for pre-patch rows must not be inferred from `transaction_date`.
- No timestamp index was added because no real timestamp read path was proven.
- No report semantics changed.
- Timestamps were not exposed to the `Note` domain object.

Remaining notes gaps:

- Full `make verify` was not proven in this slice.
- Browser/manual QA was not run.
- PostgreSQL runtime migration was not executed because PostgreSQL is not active.
- Timestamp read-path/index hardening is not approved.

## 4. Current Payment/Refund Audit Facts

Current migration facts:

`customer_payments`:

- Migration: `database/migrations/2026_03_14_000600_create_customer_payments_table.php`
- Columns:
  - `id`
  - `amount_rupiah`
  - `paid_at`
- Index:
  - `paid_at`

Payment method/cash detail alter:

- Migration: `database/migrations/2026_04_27_000700_add_payment_method_and_cash_details_to_customer_payments.php`
- Adds to `customer_payments`:
  - `payment_method`
  - index `payment_method`, `paid_at`
- Creates `customer_payment_cash_details`:
  - `customer_payment_id`
  - `amount_paid_rupiah`
  - `amount_received_rupiah`
  - `change_rupiah`
- FK:
  - `customer_payment_cash_details.customer_payment_id` references `customer_payments.id`
  - current migration uses `cascadeOnDelete`

`customer_refunds`:

- Migration: `database/migrations/2026_03_15_000100_create_customer_refunds_table.php`
- Columns:
  - `id`
  - `customer_payment_id`
  - `note_id`
  - `amount_rupiah`
  - `refunded_at`
  - `reason`
- Indexes:
  - `customer_payment_id`
  - `note_id`
  - `refunded_at`
  - `customer_payment_id`, `note_id`

Current timestamp gap:

- `customer_payments` has no proven `created_at` / `updated_at`.
- `customer_refunds` has no proven `created_at` / `updated_at`.
- `customer_payment_cash_details` has no proven `created_at` / `updated_at`.

## 5. Current Payment/Refund Writer Facts

Payment writer:

- `app/Adapters/Out/Payment/DatabaseCustomerPaymentWriterAdapter.php`

Current behavior:

- Inserts into `customer_payments`:
  - `id`
  - `amount_rupiah`
  - `payment_method`
  - `paid_at`
- Inserts into `customer_payment_cash_details` when cash detail exists:
  - `customer_payment_id`
  - `amount_paid_rupiah`
  - `amount_received_rupiah`
  - `change_rupiah`
- Does not write `created_at`.
- Does not write `updated_at`.

Refund writer:

- `app/Adapters/Out/Payment/DatabaseCustomerRefundWriterAdapter.php`

Current behavior:

- Inserts into `customer_refunds`:
  - `id`
  - `customer_payment_id`
  - `note_id`
  - `amount_rupiah`
  - `refunded_at`
  - `reason`
- Does not write `created_at`.
- Does not write `updated_at`.

Reader/domain facts:

- `CustomerPayment` domain object stores:
  - id
  - amount
  - paidAt
  - paymentMethod
- `CustomerRefund` domain object stores:
  - id
  - customerPaymentId
  - noteId
  - amount
  - refundedAt
  - reason
- No system timestamp is currently part of the payment/refund domain objects.
- This matches the prior `notes` approach where system timestamps remain DB/persistence concern unless a use case needs them.

## 6. Current Payment/Refund Use Case Facts

Payment write paths:

- `app/Application/Payment/UseCases/RecordCustomerPaymentHandler.php`
- `app/Application/Payment/UseCases/RecordAndAllocateNotePaymentHandler.php`
- `app/Application/Payment/Services/RecordAndAllocateNotePaymentOperation.php`
- `app/Application/Note/Services/CreateTransactionWorkspaceInlinePaymentRecorder.php`

Refund write paths:

- `app/Application/Payment/UseCases/RecordCustomerRefundHandler.php`
- `app/Application/Payment/Services/RecordCustomerRefundOperation.php`
- `app/Application/Payment/Services/RecordCustomerRefundTransaction.php`

Important behavior:

- Payment creation uses `paid_at` as business/payment date.
- Refund creation uses `refunded_at` as refund date.
- Payment/refund handlers also sync projection/audit/lifecycle behavior.
- Refund path can trigger inventory reversal and note refund lifecycle logic.
- Patch must not change payment/refund business date semantics.

## 7. Baseline Payment/Refund Proof

Focused baseline before any payment/refund patch:

Command group covered:

- `tests/Feature/Payment/RecordCustomerPaymentFeatureTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Payment/RecordAndAllocateNotePaymentFeatureTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Payment/RecordCustomerRefundFeatureTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Payment/RecordSelectedRowsCustomerRefundFeatureTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Payment/DatabasePaymentAllocationReaderAdapterFeatureTest.php`

Proof:

- PASS: 13 tests, 45 assertions.

Meaning:

- Current payment/refund behavior is green before timestamp patch.
- Any future RED must be a narrow characterization of missing timestamp columns or writer timestamp behavior, not a broad behavior regression.
- If future patch breaks these tests, inspect the timestamp compatibility and direct insert paths first.

## 8. Current Risks

### 8.1 Timestamp ambiguity

Risk:

- `paid_at` and `refunded_at` are business/domain dates.
- There is no row persistence timestamp for customer payment/refund records.
- This creates audit ambiguity similar to the original `notes` issue.

Initial likely recommendation:

- Add DB-level `created_at` for `customer_payments` and `customer_refunds`.
- Add `updated_at` only if mutation paths exist or future updates are expected.
- Keep timestamps nullable or safely backfilled to preserve direct insert compatibility.
- Do not infer historical `created_at` from `paid_at` or `refunded_at`.

### 8.2 Direct insert blast radius

Risk:

- Many tests, seeders, reporting fixtures, dashboard fixtures, note tests, payment tests, refund tests, and export tests insert `customer_payments` and `customer_refunds` directly.
- A non-null timestamp patch without safe default/backfill can break a large part of the suite.

Initial likely policy:

- Follow `notes` precedent:
  - characterization RED first,
  - nullable-safe/backfilled migration,
  - writer timestamp proof,
  - focused blast-radius proof.

### 8.3 Cash detail cascade delete

Risk:

- `customer_payment_cash_details` currently uses `cascadeOnDelete` to `customer_payments`.
- DB Blueprint 0002 warns against cascade delete financial history.
- This may be acceptable only if:
  - `customer_payments` is never deleted, and
  - cash detail is considered dependent detail, and
  - delete behavior is protected elsewhere.
- This is not yet proven.

Required audit:

- Search for delete paths on `customer_payments`.
- Verify whether payment rows are immutable and never hard-deleted.
- Decide whether `cascadeOnDelete` is safe, deferred legacy risk, or must be changed in a later migration.

## 9. Locked Decisions

- Do not reopen `notes` unless new regression proof appears.
- Do not start payment/refund schema patch before matrix row is updated.
- Do not rename locked date terms:
  - `paid_at`
  - `refunded_at`
- Do not use `created_at` as report period.
- Do not use `created_at` as payment date.
- Do not use `created_at` as refund date.
- Do not expose DB system timestamps into domain objects unless a use case requires them.
- Do not add timestamp indexes without read path proof.
- Do not change payment/refund reporting semantics.
- Do not touch supplier, inventory, UI, mobile/API, or PostgreSQL migration in the next payment/refund timestamp slice.

## 10. Safest Next Step

Update `docs/03_blueprints/db/0004_db_audit_matrix.md` rows for:

- `customer_payments`
- `customer_refunds`

Move both from `Reported` to `Audited`.

Required matrix content:

- migration facts,
- current writer facts,
- direct insert blast-radius risk,
- baseline proof,
- cascade delete risk for cash details,
- patch allowed now: No,
- required proof before patch.

Then create a narrow patch blueprint only if the matrix row is accepted.

## 11. Recommended Next Commands

Inspect delete paths before any patch:

~~~bash
rg -n "customer_payments.*delete|delete\\(\\).*customer_payments|DB::table\\('customer_payments'\\)->delete|from\\('customer_payments'\\).*delete|cascadeOnDelete" app tests database --glob '*.php'
~~~

Inspect direct insert blast radius narrowly:

~~~bash
rg -n "DB::table\\('customer_payments'\\)->(insert|updateOrInsert)|DB::table\\('customer_refunds'\\)->(insert|updateOrInsert)" tests database app --glob '*.php'
~~~

Create RED only after matrix audit is updated:

~~~bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/Payment/RecordCustomerPaymentFeatureTest.php tests/Feature/Payment/RecordCustomerRefundFeatureTest.php
~~~

## 12. Opening Prompt For Next Session

Lanjut HyperPOS DB hardening dari docs/03_blueprints/db/. notes timestamp slice sudah Focused Verified dengan RED missing notes.created_at, targeted GREEN, focused 31/186, docs aligned, diff check clean. Jangan reopen notes kecuali ada regression proof. Current active group: customer_payments + customer_refunds. Payment/refund audit already collected: migrations show paid_at/refunded_at but no system timestamps, writers do not write timestamps, domain objects do not expose timestamps, baseline payment/refund tests pass 13/45, and customer_payment_cash_details has cascadeOnDelete risk that must be audited. Next safest step: update 0004_db_audit_matrix.md rows for customer_payments and customer_refunds to Audited, no schema patch yet.

## 0011 Work Item Timestamp Readiness Closure - 2026-05-15

Status: Focused Verified.

Scope:
- `work_items`
- `work_item_service_details`
- `work_item_external_purchase_lines`
- `work_item_store_stock_lines`

Production files changed:
- `database/migrations/2026_05_15_000005_add_operational_timestamps_to_work_item_tables.php`
- `app/Adapters/Out/Note/DatabaseWorkItemWriterAdapter.php`
- `app/Adapters/Out/Note/WorkItemLineInsertsTrait.php`
- `app/Adapters/Out/Note/WorkItemServiceUpdateGuardsTrait.php`

Test files changed:
- `tests/Feature/Database/WorkItemTimestampSchemaTest.php`
- `tests/Feature/Note/WorkItemWriterTimestampFeatureTest.php`

Docs changed:
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0011_work_item_timestamp_readiness_hardening_patch_blueprint.md`
- `docs/03_blueprints/db/0004_db_audit_matrix.md`
- `docs/99_archive/handoff/db/0001_db_hardening_notes_payment_refund_handoff.md`

Proof:
- RED schema proof: `WorkItemTimestampSchemaTest` failed with `Missing work_items.created_at`.
- RED writer proof: `WorkItemWriterTimestampFeatureTest` failed with SQL `Unknown column 'created_at'`.
- GREEN targeted proof: `4 passed / 36 assertions`.
- Focused blast-radius proof: `45 passed / 321 assertions`.
- Docs closure proof: `0011_work_item_timestamp_readiness_hardening_patch_blueprint.md` shows `Status: Focused Verified`.
- Matrix closure proof: `work_items`, `work_item_service_details`, `work_item_external_purchase_lines`, and `work_item_store_stock_lines` rows show `Focused Verified`.
- Docs hygiene proof: `git diff --check` clean for 0011 docs closure.
- User reported `make push` and `make verify` are safe/passing; exact local command output was not pasted in this chat, so local terminal output remains the stronger proof if needed.

Locked decisions:
- `created_at` and `updated_at` are system row timestamps only.
- Do not use work item timestamps as business/report dates.
- Do not change payment/refund allocation math.
- Do not change inventory movement/reversal semantics.
- Do not change note revision semantics.
- Do not change FK/delete semantics.
- Do not add timestamp indexes without read-path proof.
- PostgreSQL runtime migration remains not executed.

Remaining gaps:
- Browser/manual QA not run.
- PostgreSQL runtime migration not executed.
- Timestamp read-path/index hardening not approved because no read path currently proves filtering/sorting by work item `created_at` / `updated_at`.

Next safe step:
- Do not re-audit completed `Focused Verified` rows unless local command output/source conflict appears.
- Do not patch `product_inventory` or `product_inventory_costing` with generic timestamps; both are projection/snapshot tables and remain deferred until projection materialization semantics are selected.
- Select the next unresolved DB hardening target from `docs/03_blueprints/db/0004_db_audit_matrix.md`.
- If no P0 temporal timestamp target remains except deferred projections, move to the next matrix-backed category only after a narrow blueprint: reversal/adjustment tables, actor/reason/audit linkage, FK/delete hardening, or CRUD/read-path hardening.
- First action in the next session should inspect only unresolved/non-verified rows and propose one active table group. No patch first.

Active task:
Find the next unresolved DB hardening target from `docs/03_blueprints/db/0004_db_audit_matrix.md`.

Rules for first response:
1. Inspect only unresolved/non-verified rows.
2. Do not analyze completed `Focused Verified` rows again.
3. Treat `product_inventory` and `product_inventory_costing` as deferred/audited projections unless owner explicitly selects projection materialization policy.
4. Pick one active next table group only.
5. Produce the minimum command needed to inspect that next group.
6. Do not patch anything yet.

Suggested first local command:
`awk -F'|' '/^\| `/ && $17 !~ /Focused Verified/ {print NR ":" $0}' docs/03_blueprints/db/0004_db_audit_matrix.md`
